Now I know it's a drag to hear some old dude lecture you... but life won't wait for you to play catch-up. You're young, the world is yours, blah blah blah, right? But you do have a gift, you have the fever to take images, to frame the world only the way you envision it. Now, all you need is the courage to share your gift with others.

Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_Dial04_Courtney_030="As if. She plays it so shy."

Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_Dial04_Taylor_040="She's so fucking shy she take selfies with a giant camera."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_DiscussionLoop_Jefferson_010="Yes Victoria, you still have to do your homework this week, even if you're submitting your photo for the competition. Everybody in class is turning in a photo, so you see the dilemma."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_DiscussionLoop_Jefferson_030="You have just by participating, by putting yourself out there in the world. Well, no matter who wins, this is just a bump on a bigger road. I don't want anybody to feel excluded from this process. But I also want everybody to know that this photographic world is not for everybody. I had my moment in the camera eye and everybody should have that chance, right?"
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_DiscussionLoop_Victoria_020="I know Mr. Jefferson. I just worked so hard on this shot, and I'm sure you know what it's like to be consumed by your work. I just really think "Everyday Heroes" is an important cultural event and I want to represent Blackwell Academy."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_DiscussionLoop_Victoria_040="Oh totally. I only want to share whatever gifts I have with the world..."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffGivingLesson_Jefferson_010="Now, can you give me an example of a photographer who perfectly captured the human condition in black and white? Anybody? Bueller?"
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffGivingLesson_Jefferson_030="There you go, Victoria! Why Arbus?"
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffGivingLesson_Jefferson_050="She saw humanity as tortured, right? And frankly, it's bullshit. Shh, keep that to yourself. Seriously though, I could frame any one of you in a dark corner, and capture you in a moment of desperation. And any one of you could do that to me. Isn't that too easy? Too obvious? What if Arbus chose to capture people at the height of their beauty or innocence? She had a brilliant eye, so she could have taken another approach."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffGivingLesson_Jefferson_070="Me too, Victoria. He captured the essence of post-war, beat America. And there was honesty about the economic conditions of the era, but a beauty in the struggle. You don't have beauty without a beat. Which explains why Frank was Kerouac's photographic muse and both were the great chroniclers of the 1950's. Well... We've all seen that iconic shot of Kerouac on the balcony —and if you haven't, shame, shame— capturing the romantic urban solitude of the 20th century poet. You dig?"
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffGivingLesson_Jefferson_080="Now, contrast Frank's stark Americana, with Salvador Dali's surrealist photographs. Like Cocteau, he was a true renaissance man, and his famous self-portraits are famous early examples of that truly awful word you pesky kids love so much, the "selfie"... And it's a great tradition, and I wholeheartedly fight for your right to self-expression. Or selfie-expression. Heh, sorry, I know."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffGivingLesson_Jefferson_090="So if anybody wants to question the portrait as modern narcissism, they could go back hundreds of years to blame society. Speaking of questions, I bet you thought I'd talk all the way until the bell rang. It's your turn to lecture us. Now, based on the chapters I have no doubt you all memorized, who can tell me the name of the actual process that led to the birth of the self-portrait?"
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffGivingLesson_Victoria_020="Diane Arbus."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffGivingLesson_Victoria_040="Because of her images of hopeless faces. You feel like, totally haunted by the eyes of those sad mothers and children."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffGivingLesson_Victoria_060="I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of her work. I prefer... Robert Frank."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffIntroDial_Jefferson_030="No, Victoria, excuse us."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffIntroDial_Jefferson_040="Max Caulfield, so you finally decided to turn in a photograph for the contest."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffIntroDial_Max_010="Excuse me, Mr. Jefferson, can I talk to you for a moment?"
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffIntroDial_Max_050="Er..."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffIntroDial_Victoria_020="Yes, excuse you."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffWaitingAnswerLoop_Jefferson_010="Anybody? ... This does not bode well."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffWaitingAnswerLoop_Jefferson_020="Just jump right in with an answer."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffWaitingAnswerLoop_Jefferson_030="This was in the chapters you read."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffWaitingAnswerLoop_Jefferson_040="You did read the chapters, right?"
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffWaitingAnswerLoop_Jefferson_060="Your silence is deafening."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffWaitingAnswerLoop_Jefferson_070="If this were a photo, I'd call it a still life."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_JeffersonTalks_Jefferson_010="I see you, Max Caulfield. Don't even think about leaving here until we talk about your entry."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_MaxAnswers_Jefferson_010="The Daguerreian Process made portraiture hugely popular, mainly because it gave the subjects clear defined features. You can learn more when you actually finish reading the assigned chapters. Max is so far, way ahead of everybody."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_MaxAwake01_Jefferson_030="Alfred Hitchcock famously called film "little pieces of time" but he could be talking about photography, as he likely was. These pieces of time can frame us in our glory and our sorrow; from light to shadow; from color to chiaroscuro..."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_MaxAwake01_Max_010="Whoa!"
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_MaxAwake01_Max_020="I didn't fall asleep, and... that sure didn't feel like a dream... Weird."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_MaxSurprised_Max_010="I did it... I actually did it!"

Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_Polaroid_Broken_Max_010="Man, I cannot believe this..."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_Polaroid_Picture01_Jefferson_010="Shh, I believe Max has taken what you kids call a "selfie"... A dumb word for a wonderful|photographic tradition. And Max... has a gift."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_Polaroid_Picture01_Jefferson_020="Of course, as you all know, the photo portrait has been popular since the early 1800s. Your generation was not the first to use images for selfie-expression. Sorry. I couldn't resist. The point remains that the portraiture has always been a vital aspect of art, and photography, for as long as it's been around."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_VictoriaJoke02_Victoria_010="Maybe Max is scared of the digital age."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_VictoriaJoke02_Victoria_020="I think it's awesome that Max knows her limitations."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_VictoriaJoke_Jefferson_010="Sorry Max, you're off the island."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_VictoriaJoke_Jefferson_020="Is there anybody here who knows their stuff?"
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_VictoriaJoke_Jefferson_050="Very good, Victoria. The Daguerreian Process brought out fine detail in people's faces, making them extremely popular from the 1800s onward. The first American daguerreotype self-portrait was done by Robert Cornelius."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_VictoriaJoke_Jefferson_060="You can find out all about him... In your textbook."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_VictoriaJoke_Jefferson_070="Or even... online."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_VictoriaJoke_Victoria_030="Louis Daguerre was a French painter who created "daguerreotypes" a process that gave portraits a sharp reflective style, like a mirror."
Cue_E1_2A_ArtClass_VictoriaJoke_Victoria_040="Now you're totally stuck in the Retro Zone. Sad face."

Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Evan_003="My my. This quiet child knows things."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Evan_007="Oh my, you can't even tell the difference between street photography and photojournalism...No portfolio peek for you."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Evan_010="Well, they both were famous war photographer images, but you should know the difference. Good try, wrong answer."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Evan_012="You are a kindred spirit, Max. Would you care for a perusal of my portfolio? It's not a privilege I grant to many..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Evan_028="Unless he could travel back in time, McCurry was born five years after the "Falling soldier" picture. McCurry also shoots in color. In other words, no portfolio."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Max_002="Robert Capa, of course. I love his work, despite the controversy about that photo."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Max_004="That's why I'm here."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Max_006="Isn't it Robert Doisneau?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Max_009="Gotta be... Eugene Smith."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Max_013="I'd be honored, sir."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Max_026="Hey, Evan. Mind if I check out your cool portfolio?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase01_Max_027="Uh... Steve McCurry?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase02_Evan_001="Of course, you're honored. As I am. And I hope you don't judge my work too harsh."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase02_Evan_003="Sorry, I have to get back to my portfolio. No time for amateurs. No offense, Max."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase02_Evan_004="Sorry, I have to get back to my portfolio."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase03_Evan_001="As you can see, Rachel Amber was my favorite model here. She knew exactly what angles worked best with my eye."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase03_Evan_002="Like brother and sister in arms. She understood me, never judged me. I hated her Vortex Club clique, but she never acted like she cared. Her friends were her friends."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase03_Evan_005="She was like mercurial. You know what that means?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase03_Evan_009="Nothing good Max... Nothing good."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase03_Max_003="You were close..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase03_Max_004="What was she like?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase03_Max_006="Of course I do, you snob."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase03_Max_007="I know, I can be a little diva."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase03_Max_008="What do you think happened to her?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHEvan_Phase03_Max_010="Hi, Evan."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_001="Excuse me, Max? I know everybody loves being asked to sign a petition, but would you do|Ms. Grant a favor and hear me out?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_004="Too bad. Serious things are taking place at Blackwell and they effect you most of all. Come back and see me when you do have time, promise?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_005="David Madsen, our chief of security, wants to put surveillance cameras all around the campus. Halls, classrooms, gym, dorm rooms, etc.  Blackwell Academy should be a high school, not a high security penitentiary."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_008="Blackwell Academy has a noble heritage, from the Native Americans who founded this land, to the pioneers who shared it in peace, not fear and violence."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_009="It's a slippery slope. And it's up to you and your classmates to stand up here."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_012="The tribes who were here first, who welcomed the settlers. Both cultures found a mutual symbiosis and thrived."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_013="You should learn a little history about your alma mater. You'll find some fascinating facts. There's a lot of power in this region. I think it helps the creative juices flow around here..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_014="Now before I assign you homework with this lecture, will you please sign the petition to keep our campus from going back to 1984?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_017="I'm not against security, Max. We should all be concerned when private space becomes public. Your generation has been tricked to think everything should be recorded."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_018="I knew you were my favorite new student at Blackwell for a good reason."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_030="Max, this isn't about personalities. This is about protecting civil rights and our school's legacy of freedom."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_032="You're fair minded, Max. And we all pray Rachel is found safe and sound, bless her soul. But this petition isn't about her."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_034="Science is history, Max. And I have a secret wish to teach local lore and legends. There's a lot of unique facts about this you might really enjoy discovering..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_035="Do you want to hear more about this petition now Max?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_038="It's all about time, isn't it? If you change your mind and want more details, please come back and see me."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_002="Well... I'm kind of in a rush right now, I don't really have the time..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_003="Sure, I always have time for you. What's the petition?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_006="David Madsen doesn't need another excuse to harass students here..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_007="That's crazy. I get why schools should be on high alert these days, but cameras in the dorm rooms?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_010="The Native Americans?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_011="Blackwell is that old? That's incredible."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_015="Absolutely. I don't mind security, but not... pure surveillance."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_016="Ms Grant, I totally respect your passion and knowledge, but some security cameras make me feel a little safer."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_029="Hi, Ms. Grant."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_031="I guess cameras could have helped Rachel. I can see both sides."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_033="You know a lot about Blackwell for being the science teacher."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_036="Sure, I like to get all the facts first."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_037="Well... I'm still in a rush, I don't really have the time..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase02_Grant_002="The petition is going well. I think we'll hit our goal!"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHGrant_Phase02_Grant_004="At least I know where you stand, Max. Always in front of the camera."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_001="There she is, the retro-selfie master."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_004="It's a skill one cultivates at Blackwell. Especially when one represents the Vortex Club. Not to boast."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_005="Oh please. Nathan is like everybody's voodoo doll. "Kill the rich kid!" He's all right, and a fun guy to hang with. Fuck the haters."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_008="Only if you're not cool enough to get in. And it doesn't hurt your resume."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_010="I do. But you should actually come hang with us one night. Then you wouldn't be so inclined to gossip."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_013="That's because you haven't partied with us. Or even Victoria. Who's pretty funny when she's baked."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_014="Chillax, paranoia girl. We're not that desperate for fun. We know how to do that on our own."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_016="You're high. Rachel used to hang out with us too. She was a blast. Smart, not bitchy like... you know."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_021="Nate has his extreme moments, but... don't we all?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_022="Your loss. Bro is fucking hilarious when he's blazed. And he does always have the best shit."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_025="I knew she liked to party. Hah, fun to be around. Oh yeah, and she was hot."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_027="Bye Max. Now, I have to get my chemical on|and study. We should get you and Dana out one night..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_029="Oh, whatever happens to people who disappear without a trace."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_031="Don't think you know Victoria so well. She respected Rachel, even if she didn't act like it."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_033="No. Rachel was like her own club. She was actually too cool for us. And I'll deny I ever said that."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_035="That it is, Max. Now I have to get my chemical on and study. We should get you and Dana out one night..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_037="Hey yourself, Max."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_002="That's me all right. You look relaxed as usual, Hayden."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_003="Do you really want Nathan Prescott to "represent"?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_006="What the hell is the Vortex Club anyway? Seems so elitist..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_007="He seems genuinely unstable to me."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_009="If you say so..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_011="I don't think so. I'm not Ms. Party."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_012="You mean hang with the Vortex Club? That sounds like a set-up to a horrible prank..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_015="It seems weird to think about partying with all those Rachel Amber posters up..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_019="Hey, Hayden."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_020="Fair enough, but I'm still not going to party with him."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_023="I don't know yet, Hayden."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_024="So you knew Rachel Amber?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_026="Let's talk later, Hayden."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_028="What do you think happened to her?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_030="Did Victoria like Rachel? She seems like the jealous type."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_032="Rachel was actually a member of the Vortex Club?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_034="I'm more confused than before... It's such a mystery. Let's talk later Hayden."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_036="Hey again, Hayden."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase02_Hayden_001="Seriously. I have to study for a test now, so I can't talk now."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHHayden_Phase02_Hayden_002="Max, you're harshing my mellow."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Justin_001="Check out the Max. Come to thrash?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Justin_004="You're such a poser. If you can't even name a simple noseslide or a tre flip, you should walk on."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Justin_005="What's your first move gonna be?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Justin_008="Oh, sick, you're not a poser."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Justin_010="Oh check it. We're gonna destroy some rails for you. What do you want to see?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Justin_020="Let's get Trevor all over that action."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_002="Thrash? You mean stage diving or..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_003="Oh, yeah. Bring it."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_006="Uh... jump?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_007="I came to noseslide, but I'd love to see somebody do a "tre flip"!"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_009="Nah, I just can't skate worth shit."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_018="I'd love to see a... noseslide."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_019="Go for a "tre flip"."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_021="Yo, Justin."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Justin_003="I'm stoked to see those photos framed and shit. You're not really a Skate Betty tho."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Justin_006="Too bad. It's nice to have the females on board too. Rachel Amber and her punk friend used to love skating with us."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Justin_008="I can tell. We need more girls out here. Rachel Amber and her punk friend used to skate with us..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Justin_010="She used to chill with us sometimes. But one day she just vanished... Hope she's livin' the dream somewhere. If anybody hurt her we'll get a skate posse and take 'em out with our boards."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Justin_011="I can't remember her name... But she was hot. Tats. Blue hair. Hardcore. She stopped hanging out with us after Rachel disappeared... or ran away."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Justin_015="Max appears again. What's up?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Justin_018="Anytime you want to take some action shots, we're here for you, Max."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Justin_019="Fuck that! I'd rather rollerblade than hang out with snobs like her."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Justin_020="You're not really a Skate Betty."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Max_004="Not really."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Max_005="I used to be, but I'm into my camera now."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Max_012="You knew Rachel?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Max_013="Who was Rachel's punk friend?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Max_014="Hey."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Max_016="You ever hang out with Victoria?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase02_Max_017="Let's chill later, Justin."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase03_Justin_002="We're done talking. You're too sketchy!"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHJustin_Phase04_Justin_001="You can watch us destroy these rails!"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_001="Max, I don't feel like talking..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_004="Nathan Prescott, little rich bitch kid. He thinks he can own people like his parents own Blackwell... Like he owns the Vortex Club."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_007="You... You know him?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_008="Somebody needs to take that prick down..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_013="What? Seriously?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_014="Sounds like you know way more than that. Max, tell me."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_015="Yeah, history always proves that, right? Just wait for justice, you sheeple..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_017="You are my new hero. Finally, karma comes to Blackwell!"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_002="What's wrong?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_003="Oh sorry... I won't bother you."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_006="Yes, he's a nasty piece of work."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_009="I busted him today, with a gun."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_010="Not really... I've seen him around."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_011="It'll happen... Karma doesn't play favorites."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_012="He'll take himself down."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_016="I saw him wave a gun around today and I went to the Principal... We'll see what happens next..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_018="Uh, hello?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_019="Nope, he's just a entitled dick with a lot of money. Not my type."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase02_Luke_001="I'm glad you told me that, Max. Let's talk later, cool?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHLuke_Phase02_Luke_002="Let's talk later, okay Max?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Max_002="I think so. We're lucky to have such a famous teacher. And I actually love his work..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Max_003="He's aloof...He seems like he's always above you, not like a snob, but like you don't know what's in his head."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Max_007="Now how do you know this?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Max_009="Interesting. See, you learn something new everyday at school."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Max_010="So you knew Rachel?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Max_013="Hey there, Stella."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Max_014="I'm not sure yet, I mean, he's clearly a genius. But I don't agree with everything he says."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Max_017="Victoria is pretty obvious. I don't think Jefferson is into her."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Max_018="Now that you mention it, he doesn't respond to Victoria's flirting. That means he has good taste."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Max_020="No way. You can get him so busted. And he's not going to mess around with a student."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Stella_001="Hey, I know you! You're the new quiet girl in Jefferson's class. Isn't he incredible?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Stella_004="Me too. His New York urban stuff is great, but I'm glad he came back to his Oregon roots. Screw the East Coast elite. It must piss off those pretentious galleries that Mark Jefferson is teaching photography to us Blackwell hicks... plus he is pretty hot for an older guy."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Stella_005="Maybe. Mr. Jefferson just has his own style."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Stella_006="If Victoria wasn't all over him, I would definitely make a move."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Stella_008="That's what you think."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Stella_011="Not really. I saw her hanging with the other cool kids like Victoria. Not my kind of clique. But I heard insane stories about Rachel..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Stella_012="Like I said, you have a lot to learn, Max. See ya in class."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Stella_015="He does get a bit pretentious, but he's passionate and just says what he thinks."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Stella_016="I don't think she's closed the deal. But she's not the only player..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase01_Stella_019="You have a lot to learn here at Blackwell. Rachel Amber absolutely had sex with him. Well... I heard that from a good source."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_CHStella_Phase02_Stella_001="I'd like to study this photo if you don't mind."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_DanielDraws_Daniel_010="Oh, that's a good posture."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_DanielDraws_Daniel_020="Good, good..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_DanielDraws_Max_030="Best portrait ever."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_DroneControl_Brooke_010="Here, give the drone a whirl around campus."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_FactNathan_Principal_010="Would Nathan Prescott please come to the front office. Thank you."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_Idle_Grant_010="Would anybody like to sign a petition to stop Blackwell from becoming a surveillance state?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_Idle_Grant_020="This is a very important issue that effects all of you here."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_Idle_Grant_030="We just need to collect 100 more signatures to get a public hearing..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_Idle_Grant_040="We all want to be safe but not spied upon."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_Idle_Grant_050="And this isn't about any politics, just about our Blackwell's great tradition of free speech."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_Idle_Grant_060="I know you're in a hurry to text before your next class but this is important too..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_Idle_Grant_070="What if Big Brother was watching what you're texting? Are you cool with that?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_Idle_Grant_080="Is anybody listening?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_Idle_Grant_090="Anybody?"
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_StellaFriend_CitizenF1_020="I love the contrasts."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_StellaFriend_Stella_010="Oh his work is so sensitive..."
Cue_E1_3A_CampusA_StellaFriend_Stella_030="Mr. Jefferson is a master of light and shade..."

Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHBrooke_Phase02_Brooke_015="True. And Warren really loves to talk meteorology with me, since I'm one of the few who can talk back. Talk to you later, Max."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHBrooke_Phase02_Brooke_016="Lucky you. I'm sure he'll track you down, Max. I'll see you around."

Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHBrooke_Phase02_Max_005="I can't tell if you're being serious or not... Um, since I'm a science noob, I was wondering if you could explain it..."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHBrooke_Phase02_Max_013="No, not at all. He's my friend, not my mother."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHBrooke_Phase02_Max_014="I will later."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHBrooke_Quick02_Brooke_001="I don't have time, Max. I can't talk now."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHBrooke_Quick02_Brooke_002="Really, Max?"
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Juliet_001="Hey Max, did you check out Kate's hot video yet?"
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Juliet_004="I didn't get wasted on camera and get busy with the Vortex Club."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Juliet_005="Because it's fucking hilarious. "Church Girl Gone Wild.""
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Juliet_007="Really? Check her out and tell me what she's like."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Juliet_009="Touche. Now I feel like an ass. Thanks for finding out the truth yesterday."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Juliet_013="Nothing... yet. My mind works in devious ways too."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Juliet_014="When he acts like a worm, I let him dangle."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Juliet_015="Not at you. Part of me was almost disappointed, because I built up so much rage."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Juliet_017="You have a good heart, Max... And I won't watch Kate's video anymore. Or pass it on."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Juliet_019="Sure, talk to you later."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Max_002="That's so not cool."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Max_003="Why should I?"
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Max_006="Kate's not like that and you know it."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Max_008="Do you believe everything you see? Like Zachary sexting Dana?"
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Max_010="What did you do about Victoria pulling that crap?"
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Max_011="Are you sure? I thought you'd be pissed..."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Max_012="What about Zachary? Did you let him off the hook?"
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Max_016="Glad to see you're back in action."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Max_018="That's the spirit! Thanks Juliet."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Phase01_Max_020="Hello Juliet."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Quick01_Juliet_001="I'm not watching the video, Max."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CHJuliet_Quick01_Juliet_002="Excuse me, I'm texting Zach."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CourtneyHomework_Courtney_020="Yeah, of course, Victoria. I'll get the tests and papers to you this afternoon. I am so on it. Consider it done."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_CourtneyHomework_Victoria_010="Courtney, seriously, do not forget I need those papers before tonight. Like, now. Thanks, cherie."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_KateVideo_Brooke_020="I didn't think Kate was like this... Macking on those bros? Ew."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_KateVideo_Brooke_040="Everybody's seen it by now..."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_KateVideo_Juliet_010="Gross. The Vortex Club are such pigs. I'm glad I pissed them off."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_KateVideo_Juliet_030="We shouldn't be watching this..."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_Knock02_Kate_020="Yes, I'm here. Come in, Max..."

Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_Warn_Alyssa_Alyssa_030="Wow, now that was close. Thank you, Max."
Cue_E2_1A_Corridor_Warn_Alyssa_Max_010="Alyssa, can you stand over there?"
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_002="No Max, I don't hate you. Not that I don't like juicy gossip... I just wish you weren't so nosey."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_005="Or a gift. You're very good at being nosey."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_009="At least we're showing our faces together in public... So you absolutely should go with us. Borrow one of my outfits and come as a cute geek couple with your bitch Warren..."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_021="By the way, the best and biggest news of the day is that Trevor asked me to the Halloween shindig."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_036="Much better than yesterday. I'm glad we talked."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_037="Oh yeah. Thanks again for releasing me from her captivity."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_041="You're almost psychic. I felt like you knew everything anyway..."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_042="I would laugh, but you did save me yesterday. So let's call it even."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_052="Don't let life pass you by, Max. So, are you coming to the party, or not?"
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_056="That's the spirit, Max! After this you'll be ready for a rave..."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_057="You came to Blackwell to discover yourself, not hide in your dorm."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_001="Uh, hi, Dana. Do you hate me?"
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_003="It's like my fatal character flaw."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_007="Are you? I'm not trying to get into your business..."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_022="That's awesome, Dana."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_034="Hi Dana, how are you?"
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_035="What's happening, Dana? Everything cool between you and Juliet?"
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_038="Because I care."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_039="Me too. I know it's good just to talk about... this stuff."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_044="Err, I'm not big on cosplay."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_049="I won't discover myself avoiding projectile vomit from bro-dudes. Thanks anyway."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_053="Why the fuck not? If I hate it, I can always go back... to my room."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_054="No, sorry. It's just... not my thing."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Phase01_Max_055="It does sound like fun. Now I have to go contemplate my party future..."
Cue_E2_1A_DanaRoom_CHDana_Quick01_Dana_001="Let's talk later, Max."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_Believe_Kate_020="Bless you Max. I will go to the police... and also Principal Wells. With you as my back-up witness, they'll have to take us seriously now."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_Believe_Kate_040="Why? Careful of what?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_Believe_Max_010="Yes, you should definitely go to the police, Kate. I totally believe every word you say. Nathan Prescott is truly dangerous."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_Believe_Max_030="Back-up witness? Well, I mean, I believe you and everything, but... we're still just spoiled punk students to the cops and faculty... I just think we need to be very careful here..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_Believe_Max_050="Nothing... except the Prescotts are a powerful family. I hope this won't backfire on us, that's all. Even though that rich bastard has earned some serious bad karma. He'll get it..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_001="Max, why did you step in between David and me yesterday?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_002="Max, why didn't you do anything when David harassed me yesterday?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_008="I was hoping he would. But it's nice to see that you care about me..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_009="I don't expect you to get in trouble for me. I just feel like nobody cares..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_010="I thought he was different. I'm happy to see that somebody cares..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_011="You had the choice to not get involved. Nobody here seems to care about anybody..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_013="Well..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_014="He's a total paranoid ass! He thinks I'm part of the Vortex Club. Yeah, right."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_018="I can't even watch it, Max..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_019="I went to a Vortex Club party against my better judgment. Not my scene at all."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_020="Because he saw the video."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_023="Thank you, Max."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_024="Are you kidding?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_025="Do you know how humiliating this is for me?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_033="Basically, I went to one Vortex Club party and ended up|making out with a bunch of people... and I have no memory of it..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_037="Lapse of sanity? I just thought I could meet some new people."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_038="I didn't."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_039="It's a long story. I'm still trying to sort it all out..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_041="I swear to God I had one sip of red wine. And then I drank water."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_044="I don't get wasted. Ever."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_045="I take a sip at church and I don't end up on a viral video, okay?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_048="I remember... I remember getting sick and dizzy..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_049="Then Nathan Prescott said he would take me to the hospital..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_054="He was being nice for a change when he offered to help me."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_055="Definitely not. I'm not sure where I went..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_056="Sick enough to need a doctor. I thought I was dying, Max."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_061="All I recall is driving for a long time... then I woke up in a room... I thought it was a hospital because it was so white and bright..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_065="That's all I remember! I don't know what happened... I woke up outside my dorm room the next day. I didn't have any marks or bruises, but I felt gross."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_066="Of course—you think I'm making this crap up? Why?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_069="I have no idea. Probably Victoria. She was there being her mean self."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_071="How do I get a viral video taken down? I know it's already spreading—what if my church sees that? I need to know what to do..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_077="Somebody was talking to me in a soft voice... I thought it was a doctor... until I heard Nathan and felt a sharp sting in my neck... and... and..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_003="Go on, I'm listening."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_004="I hate bullies. David Madsen should know better."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_005="I'm sorry. I was scared. I can be pretty gutless."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_006="I wanted proof David was in your face."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_007="I had no choice. David Madsen is an asshole."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_012="Kate, I actually do care. So, what's the story with you and David?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_015="What about this video? And I swear I haven't watched it."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_016="Did you party with them?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_017="Why does he think that?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_021="I won't either."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_022="Should I watch it? Just for... posterity?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_026="I know this sucks, Kate, but... tell me about the video and maybe I can help."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_034="So, why would you go?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_035="Doesn't sound like you. I can't see you partying with Victoria..."
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_036="That's awful. So, how did that happen?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_040="You have to tell me more than that. What happened at the party? Did you drink?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_042="Not enough to get wasted, is it?"
Cue_E2_1A_KateRoom_CHKate_Phase01_Max_043="Are you sure it was just one sip?"

Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultFem_Phase01_Max_023="I just got off the school bus, but I'm sure the regular bus is coming too."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultFem_Phase01_Max_026="Are things that bad here?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultFem_Phase01_Max_028="Well, good luck!"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultFem_Phase01_Max_030="Hi, you look... lost."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultFem_Phase02_AdultFem_001="I'll just keep waiting and hope the bus comes."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMal02_Phase01_AdultMal02_001="No time for chit-chat. I'm a millionaire, yep. Got my lottery ticket right here. Waiting for the bus so I can cash it in."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMal02_Phase02_AdultMal02_001="You can't have my lottery ticket. Buy your own."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_AdultMale_001="Can you believe this town? The world is on fire and our big headline is "Snow!" I can hardly wait for next week's big story—"Clouds!""
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_AdultMale_004="Oh, global warming bullshit. It's the Northwest, snow happens."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_AdultMale_005="Long enough to know that Arcadia Bay will be a ghost town in a few years."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_AdultMale_006="The paper can only talk about that or about missing girls."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_AdultMale_010="I guess. I bet she ran away because she was bored. Who wouldn't be here?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_AdultMale_011="You're young. You'll get over it."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_Max_002="The snow was pretty odd... It was right in the middle of a warm sunny day."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_Max_003="How long have you lived here?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_Max_007="I keep reading how Arcadia Bay is booming."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_Max_008="You mean—Rachel Amber?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_Max_009="This town is more like a mystery to me..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase01_Max_012="Excuse me—sir?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHAdultMale_Phase02_AdultMale_001="Excuse me, I have to read my horoscope."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman_002="I wish, young gal. Arcadia Bay just isn't the same fishing town I grew up in."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman_005="You have a question?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman_008="By Neptune's Beard it has! Seems like a lifetime ago when I was king of the harbor."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman_010="Oh, the fish used to jump onto my boat...Until the Prescotts and their finance fiends snapped up harbor rights..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman_013="I call her the "Bali Hai." I've kept ahold of her in these lean days...might be all the time we've got left..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman_031="They might rename the town Prescott Bay, if that tells you much."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman_033="Too good for my working kind. I know them through their bad deeds..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman_035="Crooks gain respect when they put their names on schools and libraries..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman_037="Let's not get downcast. I hear the fish calling for Bali Hai... Never forget that old fishermen never die, we just smell that way!"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_001="Good morning again."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_003="Good morning. Looks like you're ready to catch some serious fish."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_006="I'd love to learn more, but I have to get going. Happy fishing out there!"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_007="Has the town changed much?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_009="You did pretty good to have lasted this long..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_012="You have your own boat?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_014="I thought one of Arcadia Bay's main exports was fish..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_030="The Prescotts have a lot of power."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_032="Do you know them?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_034="They own my school."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase02_Fisherman_001="I think I've talked my quota for the year."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_002="Aw, look at you. A fine example of youth. I bet you're a senior student."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_004="A thousand years. I've gone through the same changes as the town..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_006="Ones it takes a lifetime to see. There's a lot of beauty here, but a lot of darkness too. Greedy bastards that ruined this town, put people out of work... out of home. Like me."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_008="What didn't happen to me? Sometimes you start out in life turned around the wrong way...|I married dumb, made mistakes, got cheated out of my savings, lost my home and now|I hang out here..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_010="Where the hell would I go? I hate the sun and love the mist. I might be homeless, but Arcadia Bay is still my home."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_012="She's fed me more than my own family. Has a daughter your age who's always in trouble. Married to a real prick."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_016="He told me to "get a job" once. Asshole. Not sure what Joyce sees in him, but he better treat her right."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_018="Cute girl. Pissed off. I used to see her and her pretty friend, errr... Rachel around a lot..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_024="That whole family is dirty. They once done good things for Arcadia Bay...those days are dead. Like anything in their way..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_028="Then you be their guardian angel, because nothing gets in the way of that family, especially not the law. Hell, they own your school, Blackwell. Almost."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_036="I know she's missing. And I know she hung out here a bit. Sometimes I'd see her walking, all by herself, deep in thought. Too damn young and pretty to look so worried..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_038="Once or twice, she'd talk to me... about trouble in school, wanting to be some model in California... she was always distant. But nice."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_040="Like I said, she seemed tight with Joyce's daughter. I thought I saw her with an older gent one time, maybe her dad. That's a terrible thing for a parent to deal with."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_042="I pray the poor thing is all right... but you can't save everybody."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_046="I could tell you're a wise young woman. I know all about Blackwell and this town..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_HomelessFem_048="Sure looks that way."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_001="Hello."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_003="How long have you lived in Arcadia Bay?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_005="What changes to the town?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_007="What happened to you?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_009="I'm sorry... Have you ever lived outside of here?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_011="You must know Joyce Price from the Two Whales diner..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_015="His name is David Madsen..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_017="Have you met Joyce's daughter?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_023="I bet you have dirt on the Prescott family."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_027="I know somebody who's being threatened by a Prescott..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_035="Do you know anything about Rachel Amber, that missing girl?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_037="Did you talk to her?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_039="Was she alone a lot or with friends?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_045="Yes. I go to Blackwell Academy."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_047="Hi, I'm back again."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase03_Max_100="I have to go now. Goodbye."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_CHHomelessFem_Phase04_HomelessFem_001="Come talk to me any ol' time you want, young lady."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_BusStopAdultFem_020="Glad somebody is..."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_BusStopAdultFem_040="I wouldn't dream of it."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_BusStopOldMan_010="Yep. I'm ready to cash my lottery ticket."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_BusStopOldMan_030="Don't try to take it from me. It's mine."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_BusStopOldMan_050="I'm going to be a millionaire."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_BusStopOldMan_060="Hope nobody steals my lottery ticket."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_BusStopOldMan_070="Can't wait to be rich. Yep."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_DegueuAdultMale_100="Can I get some beer and bacon before I die?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_DegueuAdultMale_120="No beer?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_DegueuAdultMale_140="No beer... what kind of dive is this?"
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_Joyce_110="This is a diner, not a bar."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_Citizens_IGE_Joyce_130="Looks like you had plenty. Stick with the bacon."
Cue_E2_2A_DinerPark_FrankSleeping_Frank_010="Stop that, stop. No barkie."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHAdultFem02_Phase01_AdultFem02_001="Hello there to you. Such a beautiful day, eh? Oh yeah, it's going to be a super day. Enjoy your breakfast, eh?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHAdultFem02_Phase02_AdultFem02_001="Oh yeah, hello again. Back to breakfast, eh?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHAdultMal_Phase01_AdultMal_001="What do you want? I feel like shit. Too much beer. So spare me, please. Just let me suffer quietly."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHAdultMal_Phase02_AdultMal_001="Leave me alone or I will vomit on you."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_002="Okay Max, I'm hella ready."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_008="Duh, way too easy! I need details! Describe my keychain..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_014="Yes, you know I'm a smoker. But how many cigarettes?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_015="Clearly I'm rich as fuck—how much do I have?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_016="You know me well. But... what is the exact time I was busted?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_017="Nada..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_018="I left it in the car."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_020="Not. Impressed."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_025="Absolutely... wrong."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_037="Okay, Psychic Girl, let me show you what's actually in my pockets."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_086="That was so... wrong, Max."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_087="Bzzz! Wrong answer!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_088="Do you have some kind of power or not?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_089="A what? Do you even know me?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_090="Do I look like a Linux nerd like your pal, Warren?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_091="Not bad, Super Max!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_092="You do have that Irish luck, Caulfield. What else?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_098="Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Whatevs the hell that means."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_099="So that was cool, show me more!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_100="Amazing! Something else in my pockets?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_101="A superpower that allows you to count cigarettes. Cool!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_102="I smoke too much to have 13 cigarettes..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_103="You lose..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_104="I wish."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_105="That's right, living large in Arcadia Bay!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_106="That is so... wrong."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_107="Boo yah! Max can tell time!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_108="I don't even think about getting up that early."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Chloe_109="Most impressive. Now let's check to see if you got it right."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_003="So, this is me telling you what's inside your pockets."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_005="Your car keys!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_006="Some old chewing gum?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_007="Let's see... a gun?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_011="I'm pretty sure you have cigarettes on you."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_012="Some money?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_013="A parking ticket."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_021="Six cigarettes..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_022="Seven cigarettes..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_023="Thirteen cigarettes..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_026="Twenty-five cents..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_027="Eighty-two cents..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_029="Eighty-six cents..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_030="11:10 a.m."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_031="10:34 a.m."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_032="6:42 a.m."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_078="I don't know..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_079="A skull keychain for a punk like you!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_080="You definitely have a razor blade keychain..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_081="A bullet, just like your necklace!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_083="A pixel heart keychain..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_084="A penguin keychain..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_085="A cute robot panda keychain!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle01_Max_110="You have a tube of glitter in there, right?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Chloe_033="So what happens next?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Chloe_034="Well, let's just see how this goes down."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Chloe_036="This is getting good, can't wait to see what happens!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Chloe_037="Pretty bizarro, Max. But let's see if everything happens like you said..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Chloe_045="Max, you said that you would predict four events, we're nowhere near that."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Chloe_049="Max, you said that you would predict four events. That's only two, dude."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Chloe_050="Yes, you still need to tell me one more event, Max."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_003="The trucker drops his mug and Joyce rips him a new one."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_004="Trevor drops his glass and Justin makes fun of him."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_005="The cop drops his glass and Joyce argues with him."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_010="The cop gets an emergency alert on his radio and he answers it."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_011="The cop gets an emergency alert on his radio and he quickly exits the diner."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_012="The cop gets an emergency alert on his radio and his partner in the car|leaves without him."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_017="Justin and Trevor fight and Joyce beats them."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_018="Justin and Trevor fight and Joyce encourages them."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_019="Justin and Trevor fight and Joyce doesn't give a shit."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_025="The jukebox goes crazy as a cockroach crawls on it."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_026="The jukebox goes crazy as a fly lands on it."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_027="The jukebox goes crazy as the trucker tries to play a new song."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_044="Joyce drops her plate and the truckers make fun of her."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_046="The cop gets an emergency alert on his radio, but he does nothing except eat a donut."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_047="Justin and Trevor are fighting and Joyce breaks it up."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHChloe_Puzzle02_Max_048="The jukebox goes crazy as a butterfly lands on it."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_002="Hi young lady, you look a little lost."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_005="Wish I could make the Two Whales my first home. Joyce making rocket coffee and juicy burgers anytime...|You look about Chloe's age."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_008="Now, that is a real problem at the Two Whales. I can never decide—Joyce's pumpkin pie or grilled mac 'n' cheese?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_011="I know her delicious grub. Everybody at the station comes here. We take care of this place like it's our own kitchen. And Joyce like she's our... our mother."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_017="Sadly, we all know Chloe down at the station. Poor Joyce."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_020="That's good. She's not a bad person, she's had hard times, but there's no excuse for burning things."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_021="Then you know she's a handful."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_023="My dad died when I was 13. I never burned garbage cans or tagged signs. Joyce is a great mother, Chloe just isn't paying attention."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_029="You have to create your own good luck. I think Chloe would rather destroy. But I'm just a cop, not a psychologist, so..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_031="Sounds like you're a good friend. I wish she would be a great daughter and not cause Joyce so much stress."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_034="Just heard that Chloe even had a pot dealer in her room..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_035="Just heard she even just got busted with pot in her room."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_037="How do you know she was "chilling in her room"?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_039="I didn't hear it on the police scanner. Joyce said the weed belonged to Chloe's friend, but... I highly doubt that."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_050="By the way, one thing I can tell you for certain is to stay away from that RV outside."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_052="Wise policy. The guy who lives in it, Frank, is pretty sketchy himself. That's all I can say for now... I should finish up my coffee and get to work."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_057="She wouldn't. Afraid I'd go arrest somebody. As if I would. I'd just tell that loser to stay the hell away from Chloe. Or else... Just kidding. Besides, David Madsen is watching over them."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_058="Is she a friend of yours?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_059="She might have been getting high or getting her spray cans ready or whatever. I'd like to think the best of her, but she's now in the Arcadia Bay police database."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_060="I wouldn't use that word. We know each other. Why do you ask?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_063="I have respect for David. He served his country. He found his calling at Blackwell. At the station, we're happy David is exactly where he is... Not everybody can be a cop."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Cop_064="Yes?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_001="Hello, sir."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_003="No, I've been here many times. It's like a fourth home."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_004="Just hungry and thinking about what to eat."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_010="How well do you know Joyce?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_016="So you know Chloe?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_018="Not really..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_019="I know her."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_022="I know her dad died..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_028="No, I think she's just had some bad luck."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_030="She can be, but she can also be a good friend who shows up when you need her."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_032="Uh, who told you that?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_033="Uh... That's not good. Anyway. Mmm, that bacon sure smells good..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_036="Is that really a big thing? At least she was chilling in her room."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_038="I guess you're friends with David Madsen?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_049="I have to go now. Enjoy your breakfast."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_051="I usually stay away from sketchy parked vehicles."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_055="Joyce didn't tell you who?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_056="You just said so."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_061="Just curious... I'm surprised he's not a police officer in Arcadia Bay."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_062="He kinda has a reputation at Blackwell."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase01_Max_065="Hello again, officer."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHCop_Phase02_Cop_001="I'd love to lecture you over coffee, but I prefer to drink in silence and solitude."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHFisherman02_Phase01_Fisherman02_002="If by "big" you mean "none," then sure, I caught a lotta big ones today. Now let me mourn over my eggs."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHFisherman02_Phase01_Max_001="Did you catch any big ones today?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHFisherman02_Phase02_Fisherman02_001="Still mourning, thank you."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_001="You did the right thing. You moved forward with your life. I did, after William passed on. Chloe... Chloe chose to stay angry... Anyway, I hope we see more of you. Chloe needs an old friend again."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_002="Nice try, Nancy Drew. But next to you, there's only one student I'm worried about. And she's not even in school anymore."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_005="I'm glad, Max. That was his gift to us... wonderful memories. Even if Chloe doesn't understand yet."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_006="Now finish your coffee."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_013="Didn't you rebel against your best friend by letting her twist in the wind with that&nbsp;joint?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_015="Why? What did Chloe tell you?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_017="Nobody's in trouble over a doobie, Max. And I admire that you took the heat for Chloe...Like a great friend."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_019="Oh, she hit all the phases... expulsion, running away, drugs, bad boys, tattoos, piercings, blue hair... Now she's gotta rebel against her stepfather."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_022="He feels awful... And he will be punished."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_025="Do you? He's not as much of a hardass as you think. But you did tell him you had a joint, right? You took that responsibility?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_027="You know what happened. David slapped Chloe. He fucked up."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_028="David mentioned her, but I stay out of his business. I won't patrol Blackwell and he won't cook at the diner, you know?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_030="But Chloe does push David and it's not fair. He paid his dues in a war. He does care about her, along with all the students at Blackwell."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_032="So. Now let's get down to the nitty gritty. What do you want to eat?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_034="Yeah, she does provoke people. Especially David. I just want us to be a family soon. I guess it's all about time..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Joyce_036="I don't like it either, Max. David swore it would never happen again. He's true to his word. I just want us to be a family soon. I guess... I guess it's all about time..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_003="I know things were hard for you and Chloe. I feel bad I didn't call. Now my folks are in Seattle and I'm all alone at Blackwell. It's my karma."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_004="Joyce, I am so sorry about William. I have great memories of him."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_008="I think you're right, Joyce."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_009="The last good Belgian waffle I had was here when I was 13 years old. So, bring it on."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_012="David scared me when he said he might have my scholarship taken away for that stupid&nbsp;joint..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_014="I did. And I am sorry. I don't want Chloe in any more trouble... Or me."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_016="Joyce, he slapped Chloe yesterday."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_018="Chloe understands. She just needs... time. I know that sucks for you."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_020="Wish I took blame for the pot. None of this might have happened..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_021="Chloe doesn't have to tell me anything. I just know how David is at Blackwell."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_024="Chloe must have changed a lot during that time..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_026="I see why... I mean—"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_029="Well, Chloe texted me that David slapped her yesterday..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_031="He cares about Kate Marsh?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_033="I get it, Joyce. I know Chloe still likes to stir things up..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_035="That's no excuse to hit a girl. He's an adult."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_056="I was dreaming about your bacon omelette..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_057="Yesterday I took a picture of him fighting with Kate... I thought you might know why..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJoyce_Phase01_Max_058="I saw him arguing with Kate... I thought you might know why..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase01_Justin_002="Getting my coffee on before I cut class and destroy some rails. Shouldn't you be taking photos?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase01_Justin_004="Throw in a little green bud and you have the perfect hippie cocktail."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase01_Justin_007="You crack me up, Maxster. Of course, I'm baked so I'll laugh at anything."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase01_Justin_009="So where's all your homework, schoolgirl?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase01_Justin_011="Trevor finally told me about him and Dana hooking up. He got there first, so I snooze and I lose... See ya later, Max."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_001="What's up, Justin?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_003="Not yet. I need to... get my coffee on too."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_005="You are so not a hippie."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_006="I am always taking photos. I am a camera."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_008="You should be studying, bad boy."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_010="School. Speaking of buds, I saw your bro Trevor sneaking out of Dana's room."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHJustin_Phase02_Justin_001="Let's talk later when I'm not so high..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrevor_Phase01_Max_001="Hey Trevor."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrevor_Phase01_Max_003="Yeah, I saw you coming out of Dana's room."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrevor_Phase01_Max_004="No, I actually didn't."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrevor_Phase01_Max_008="How did Justin react?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrevor_Phase01_Trevor_002="Holla, Max. By the way, I know you saw me in the dorm."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrevor_Phase01_Trevor_005="Yeah, and I finally had to tell Justin because, well, he was into her too."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrevor_Phase01_Trevor_006="Thought you were staring right at my face. I guess you know now... and so does Justin."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrevor_Phase01_Trevor_007="I got him blazed, he was cool. Nobody has secrets in Blackwell anyway... See you in class, Max."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrevor_Phase02_Trevor_001="See ya around, Max!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Max_004="Oh... sorry."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Max_005="Isn't everything in here within eyesight?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Max_006="How does Joyce sound?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Max_008="Joyce rules. I want to be exactly like her when I grow up."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Max_009="Why are you being so rude?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Max_010="That's how she rolls. That's why I worship her every move."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Max_014="Errr, hello?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Trucker1_001=""Pardonne-moi," but you're in my eyesight."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Trucker1_002="That's okay, I just need to see my truck out there in the lot. Been a long night on the road and I have to make sure my baby is sleeping right..."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Trucker1_003="I don't care for your tone. You sound like Joyce."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Trucker1_007="Bossy and smartass... like you."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Trucker1_011="Looks like you're on your way. I've been coming to this dive for three years and Joyce gives me shit like it's going out of style."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Trucker1_012="Because I been on the road for 12 hours straight, hopped up on coffee and diet pills, carrying two tons of nitrate and all I want to do is eat a quiet breakfast and stare out the window. Do you mind?"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase01_Trucker1_013="Good, I can't wait to see you flipping greasy bacon in a diner when you grow up...exactly like Joyce. Now pardon me while I get back to my coffee."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker1_Phase02_Trucker1_001="No more banter, please."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker2_Phase01_Trucker2_001="I don't feel like talking right now. I gotta deliver a load of breakfast to my stomach. Over and out."
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_CHTrucker2_Phase02_Trucker2_001="I said... over—and out!"
Cue_E2_2A_Diner_ChloePuzzle02Happy_IGE_Chloe_050="I pledge allegiance to Max and the power for which she stands..."

Cue_E2_4B_ArtClass_JeffEnter_IGE_Jefferson_050="Sounds like you're giggling about a video gone viral. Maybe it involves a student, or a friend.

Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHCourtneyDial_Phase01_Courtney_014="Making my guest list easier. Ciao."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHCourtneyDial_Phase01_Courtney_016="Thanks, Max. I didn't think you noticed high fashion. Tell you what, I'll put you down on the guest list and before the party, I can give you some tips."

Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_036="I know things got a little heated yesterday in Chloe's room... Was that really your reefer?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_037="Do you mind if we talk about what happened yesterday with Chloe?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_040="Even I'm not that much of an asshole... And I am sorry about yesterday. I was wrong, but upset. Cannabis is not a big deal to you, but it has been to Chloe."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_044="She got in my face and called me a "pig." And I was still wrong. I'll make it up to Chloe. And I'm sorry."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_045="I'm sure she told you why. Did she mention... she probably stole one of my guns?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_046="If I didn't care about her, I wouldn't care at all. When I was her age I was out raising a lot more hell... She's better than that. All you kids are. So is Kate Marsh."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_049="You stepped between us at a pretty bad time. She's another matter entirely."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_050="I shouldn't have said anything. You know about that video going around..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_053="Max, this isn't just about Kate Marsh. My concern is for the safety of all Blackwell students. Including you."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_054="Soldier, you don't have the facts. You think I'm a hypocrite because I want cameras around here for the safety of the students?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_057="It will take more than Ms. Grant and her petition to find missing students."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_David_059="I don't want to fight with you anymore. I don't want to fight with anyone anymore...That's all, Max."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_038="Yes, it was. You know that marijuana is almost legal in Oregon. I can get it at Blackwell. Are you going to bust me now, Mr. Madsen?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_039="No... It belonged to a friend of mine. Are you going to bust me now, Mr. Madsen?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_041="You're a combat veteran. She's no threat to you."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_042="I don't think so. And you hit Chloe."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_043="You hit Chloe."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_047="But you treat Kate pretty bad..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_048="What about Kate?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_051="Kate hasn't done anything wrong."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_052="Is that why you hassled Kate yesterday? I took a photo of that moment for surveillance sake."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_055="That will take more than surveillance cameras."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_060="Excuse me, Mr. Madsen?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_061="Isn't that your responsibility as head of security? Unless you know something about Rachel Amber that nobody else does..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHDavid_Phase02_David_001="You best not bother chatting me up now."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHEvanDial_Phase01_Trevor_002="Yo Maxwell Smart. Talk later, cool?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_008="I'm only bothered when you avoid turning in photos. But you know this. So what can I do for you, Max?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_042="That's no secret. Word on the street is that you and Kate had a little confrontation with our security chief yesterday."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_043="You're not the only one. Do you have something you want to tell me?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_047="Of course not. Mr. Madsen isn't the most gentle soul. Do you have proof he instigated the situation?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_048="You can talk to me anytime. And Max, can I talk to you about Kate?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_049="Mr. Madsen confuses fear with security. I'm sorry Kate had to be a target of his paranoia. If you had proof I could talk to Principal Wells..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_052="Always take the shot. My number one rule of photography."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_053="Let me see that photo after class. You're already thinking like a real photographer."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_054="And Max, I promise this matter is being discussed by the faculty."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_055="I assume you know about this viral video..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_058="What if Kate brought this on herself? She means well, but maybe she doth protest too much...She seems like she's holding back the truth. Have you talked to her?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_064="Rachel Amber? What does she have to do with Kate?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_066="I miss Rachel too. But think about yourself, Max. Principal Wells told me about what you said happened in the bathroom..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_067="Rachel was nothing like Kate. Principal Wells said you had something on your mind you wouldn't tell him. You care to share?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_072="This is a serious accusation, Max."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_074="I hope so, Max. But it's easy to point fingers.|If Mr. Madsen claims you might be a pot dealer as he did, should I believe him?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Jefferson_075="I'd like to believe that, Max. It just seems like there's a lot of drama around you this week."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_007="Sorry to bother you, Mr. Jefferson..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_044="Not exactly. Never mind, sorry. I have to go and work... on my photo."

Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_046="I saw David Madsen harassing Kate yesterday. He was scaring her."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_050="My word isn't good enough? The one time I choose not to take a picture..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_051="Oh yes. I have an actual photograph, for once."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_056="Everybody knows. That's why I wanted to see you. Kate is being humiliated daily."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_057="Kate is freaked out by all of this. She can't do homework while she's being tormented on a daily basis."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_059="I will. She's mad I missed her call today. I just don't want Kate Marsh to become the next Rachel Amber..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_061="No... I just don't want Kate Marsh to be the next Rachel Amber..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_062="Yes, I talked to her on the phone today."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_063="Yes, I talked to her this morning."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_065="She needs friends and support now. I just don't want Kate Marsh to become the next Rachel Amber..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_068="That was a private conversation. Not that I wouldn't tell you..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_069="It did happen. Nathan Prescott had a gun in the girls' bathroom yesterday."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_070="Not right now. I'll tell you everything as soon as I figure it out."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_071="I saw Nathan with a gun in the girls' bathroom yesterday... I was too scared to go to Principal Wells."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_073="So you don't believe me? I would never make something like this up."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_076="Listen, should I—"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_080="With all her "Missing Persons" posters around, it's hard not to think of her..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase01_Max_081="Just between you and me, I'm worried about Kate Marsh."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHJeffDial_Phase02_Jefferson_001="Max, I'm busy. Please. We'll talk later."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Max_002="Alleged? Nathan did have a gun. Have you talked to him yet?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Max_003="There was just a lot going on with the fire alarm and everything..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Max_030="Sir?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Max_031="No... Never mind."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Max_033="No. I mean, I don't have anything to tell you..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Max_035="Mr. Madsen already treats everybody here like they're under surveillance..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Max_036="I saw Mr. Madsen hassle Kate Marsh yesterday..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Max_038="I can't focus when I'm scared..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Max_040="Probably not the same one you see."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Principal_001="Oh, hello Max. I hope this isn't about the alleged gun incident..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Principal_004="Yes. He's deeply upset about this accusation... I don't blame him. Once I have all the facts, we'll talk. For the moment, focus on your schoolwork."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Principal_005="Yes, but you were distracted by something else..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Principal_032="Ah, hello Max. Would you like to tell me what you wouldn't yesterday?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Principal_034="More secrets. Now excuse me, I have a meeting to attend."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Principal_037="Wait, wait. Do you see a pattern here, Max?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Principal_039="Please don't say that. There's nothing to be scared of at Blackwell Academy. Our head of security is overseeing a new era of campus safety."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Principal_045="You won't tell me the truth about yesterday, but you want to tell me the truth about Mr. Madsen. Sounds more like sour grapes... Excuse me now."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Principal_048="It's very easy for you to instantly accuse people of doing terrible things. Nathan, Mr. Madsen... who's next? Now if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase01_Principal_068="Glad to see you weren't about to accuse another student of something or other. Now if you'll excuse me."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHPrinDial_Phase02_Principal_001="Max, I have a meeting. Excuse me."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Max_001="Hello, Zach."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Max_003="I'm always taking pictures with my eyes."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Max_005="I won't. That's what Victoria wanted."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Max_007="She doesn't have to, though."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Max_009="It's over. Just another Blackwell mini-drama."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Max_011="Probably for all of us to talk about her. Like now."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Zachary_002="'Sup, Max. It's weird to not see you without your camera."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Zachary_004="I bet. As long as you don't talk to everybody about all that shit with the sext and Victoria..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Zachary_006="Yeah, I notice she kinda set up her own drama. Even if it fucks her over. Weird."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Zachary_008="That's what I don't get at all. She's hot, rich and talented. What more does she need? Anyway, see you at the game Friday, Max."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Zachary_010="You mean stupid shit. Man, I just don't get Victoria. What does she want?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase01_Zachary_012="Then let's not. You're pretty smart, Max. See you at the game Friday."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_CHZachary_Phase02_Zachary_001="Hey bro, later."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffDial_Jefferson_010="Excuse me, Max."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffDial_Jefferson_020="Hello? Yes? Uh... hold on."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffDial_Jefferson_030="I have to take this, so just go into class and I'll be there soon."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Jefferson_010="You have to talk to me, Kate."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Jefferson_030="Knock off this martyr crap."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Jefferson_050="I want you to be honest."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Jefferson_070="Stop acting so brittle."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Jefferson_090="Maybe this is your way of getting attention."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Kate_020="Why? It's all over, like me."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Kate_040="What do you want from me?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Kate_060="Nobody believes me anyway."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Kate_080="Being on a viral video does that."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Kate_100="That's really mean, Mr. Jefferson. You just don't get it..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Kate_130="Just leave me alone!"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_IGE_Kate_150="Oh, I see—I'm not important to you anymore... Nobody cares about me. Nobody..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_Jefferson_020="I'm trying. But you have to understand my position..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_Kate_010="So you can't help me?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffKateDial_Kate_030="Why? You don't understand mine. Nobody does... nobody..."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffersonStopsMax_Jefferson_010="Excuse me, Max... can you come over here?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffersonStopsMax_Jefferson_030="You look worried... is everything okay?"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_JeffersonStopsMax_Max_020="Sure."
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_KateLeaves_Kate_010="Please, leave me alone!"
Cue_E2_4B_Corridor_KateLeaves_Kate_020="Stop! Don't come near me!"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Brooke_001="Hi Max. Making your daily rounds?"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Brooke_004="No can do, Max. I'm all about robotics, not chemistry. Give me a drone over a beaker."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Brooke_005="Ms. Grant busted me flying it over the parking lot. She's all jacked up about surveillance bullshit. Like I was spying on Warren's new car."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Brooke_007="Oh. I guess he needed a neophyte assistant so he wouldn't be threatened. But you came to his rescue anyway."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Brooke_010="Don't let me get in your way. So long."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Brooke_013="Yet Warren ignores the experts right in front of him... Not that he would ask me for help anyway."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Brooke_014="The boy knows things."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Brooke_016="I borrowed the one he has on you."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Brooke_018="This is true, Max."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Max_002="I need to know if you can help me with a potassium experiment."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Max_003="How's your drone?"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Max_006="I'm helping Warren with his latest experiment."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Max_008="Howdy Brooke."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Max_009="Hate to hit and run, but..."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Max_011="Apparently it's my nature."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Max_012="Not me. Warren doesn't need my help."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Max_015="You already planted a GPS on him?"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase01_Max_017="Again we meet, Brooke."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase02_Brooke_001="I thought you were helping Warren with his tubes. Excuse me."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHBrookeDial_Phase02_Brooke_002="I have to finish this lap, Max. Sorry."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_001="Funny, I was just thinking about you, Max."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_012="I like the way you look like you're always thinking ahead."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_013="Thanks again for taking a stand against camera surveillance here. Every signature counts."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_014="It's too bad you didn't sign the petition, every signature counts and yours might be the one that decided."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_016="More people would rather send a text than sign a petition. That's how they keep us all distracted. Nobody will notice cameras on every square foot."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_018="Max, with students like you, we sure will."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_020="But people like David Madsen want to use them to spy."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_022="I know, Max. But the trick is to make sure Blackwell Academy does not end up like him..."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_023="Oh, this is my favorite time of year. I do love the season change. This whole campus is a visual delight. I know Mr. Jefferson loves to shoot around here."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_025="I certainly know him as a talented artist and terrific teacher. I've been here a little longer, but he's made a bigger mark..."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_027="I do, but I am certainly no artist. I'm all about the science. You can't debate numbers."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_028="I have to say, it's not quite autumn enough yet."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_031="Our climate is moving beyond explanation. Of course, some of the tribes here might see it different..."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_032="You're the artist and I'm the scientist... like yin and yang."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_034="You know my stock teacher answer—there are no dumb questions. Ask away."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_036="Neither, unless you want a face full of powder. I would add chlorine."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_040="Right back at you, Max."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_041="You signed the petition, now it's your campaign too. Thanks for stepping up."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Grant_042="It's missing somebody who should care, but no finger-pointing here, Max."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_010="Hi, Ms. Grant."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_011="I'm just thinking about all the autumn photos I want to take..."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_015="How is your campaign going?"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_017="I know. I really hope you keep those cameras from taking over Blackwell."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_019="Some of us want to use our cameras for good..."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_021="Geez, I'm not like him, Ms. Grant."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_024="You must know Mr. Jefferson pretty well by now."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_026="You must like photography."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_029="What about that snow yesterday? What's your scientific explanation?"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_030="I can't wait for fall either. It's all about the atmosphere."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_033="Ms. Grant, can I ask you a possibly dumb science question?"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_035="Would you add potassium or sodium to a chemical mix for this week's experiment?"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_037="I'm sorry, Ms. Grant, but I have to get going."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase01_Max_039="Hi again, Ms. Grant."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHGrant_Phase02_Grant_001="Go on, Max. We'll talk again. Real soon."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Max_008="Hey Warren. Are you okay? You look thoughtful, yet confused."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Max_009="Asking me for help means you're screwed."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Max_011="I'm not sure why you're letting me decide your fate, but... go-tassium!"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Max_013="I have a vision... go-dium!"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Max_015="Warren, this seems kinda dangerous. You might as well flip a switch, Frankenstein."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Max_017="I actually think you should use a lot of potassium. I mean, a shitload."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Max_019="Wrong Warren, you need to add chlorine, not potassium or sodium!"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Warren_007="Maxwell Silver Hammer! Perfect timing! I need help with this chemical experiment..."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Warren_010="I have to add either a bit of potassium or sodium. It's up to you to decide, Doctor Max."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Warren_012="Potassium it shall be. If this works, you get a free hug..."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Warren_014=""Go-dium"? That's the worst pun I have ever heard. Yet Max has spoken. Sodium it is!"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Warren_016="I'm the only mad scientist without a faithful Igor. I'll choose using the scientific method—eeny, meeny, miny, moe... Potassium!"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Warren_018="See, look at that smile. You're going to become a scientist yet... Let's do this thing!"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase01_Warren_020="Chlorine? I didn't think of that... Can't argue with a confident scientist. Let's try it!"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase02_Warren_001="Damn. Zip. Nothing. Nada."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase02_Warren_002="Check out the big brain on Max! You might be the next Heisenberg of Blackwell!"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_CHWarrenDial_Phase02_Warren_003="Yes, that was a blast, but let's keep it a professional secret, cool?"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_WarrenDial_Brooke_060="Oh you guys really broke the bounds of science."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_WarrenDial_Max_040="No, you got it."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_WarrenDial_Warren_010="Think, big brain, think..."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_WarrenDial_Warren_020="This can't be that hard..."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_WarrenDial_Warren_030="Eureka! She's got it!"
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_WarrenDial_Warren_050="Don't be so modest, Doctor Caulfield..."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_WarrenDial_Warren_080="Weird science."
Cue_E2_4B_SciClass_WarrenDial_Warren_100="She blinded me with science."

Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_069="Dad does care... even though I hurt him... He's the only one I know who believes in me..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_071="That's Lynn... she's only ten... She does have the best smile ever... I would hate to see her sad..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_074="Nice try, Max. But God put me on this roof."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_079="I don't believe in justice, Max. I don't believe in anything anymore..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_080="What difference does it make? I'm already in Hell anyway..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_081=""Matthew 11:28"... I can't believe you quoted one of my favorite passages..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_085="No... Nobody cares about me, nobody..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_094="You can't scrub my video from the internet... and that's how I'll be remembered. Unless I jump..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_095="I'd like that... I wouldn't mind just being a student again... Is it possible to go back and start over, Max?"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_096="Oh God. Please, Max. You haven't seen the looks I get... or the laughs."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_099="Yep, my life is a blip. Blackwell taught me I'm worthless. I'll prove it right now..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_105="It won't Max, it won't...I was drugged and nobody believes me, not even the students here that are supposed to be my friends."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_111="You are clueless, Max. Brooke makes fun of me, because I'm not an atheist. Maybe I am now..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_112="I saw Dana watching the video with Trevor. Some friends. Fake. Like my whole stupid life..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_113="I know... you're right. She never judged me. Or doubted me."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_114="No. If anything she's been more sweet. I guess I shouldn't judge everybody, you think?"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_121="Thanks for that, but I needed you more when I called to actually talk. That's when I needed a friend."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_124="That's your story now. How can I trust you? What about this morning when I needed help? You told me to do nothing!"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_125="Are you serious? Thank you so much..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_130="Can we really, Max? I don't believe in miracles anymore either."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_133="Like everybody at Blackwell, it's all about you. Even when I'm the victim."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_134="Max, I'm in a nightmare and I can't wake up... unless I put myself to sleep. Then everybody at Blackwell can post pics of my body... I'm already on the internet forever. No wonder they call it a "web"—nothing can ever get out. Like my video... I wish I could go back in time and erase everything..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_136="You're such a good person, Max. Even if you're full of crap. But I'll come with you...You're my friend."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_137="Oh Max... when you say it like that I want to believe you so bad..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Kate_138="Oh please! Now you want to help me? What about this morning when I needed it? You told me to do nothing!"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_004="I've been bullied too, Kate. And even when I got picked on, I stood up for myself."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_005="I only wanted proof that David was harassing you!"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_006="I had no idea what was going on between you and David..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_007="I'm so sorry, Kate. I thought I could help, but not by taking a picture. I'm ashamed..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_012="How else would I find out?"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_014="That's not true. People want to help you."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_015="Kate, don't! Please!"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_016="I let you down and I'm sorry. I only want to help you."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_017="No! Please Kate, you know me better than that... and I know you don't want to jump."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_022="Okay, okay. I'm right here. Kate, please..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_024="You matter. And not just to me."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_026="Kate, your life is still yours. And we can get through this together... Let me help."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_029="I was with Chloe and she was having a serious problem too. I'm sorry."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_030="I swear, it was in silent mode and I didn't see it or I totally would have answered!"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_031="My phone died and I didn't have my charger. I swear..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_032="Of course I worry. You're my friend, Kate."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_033="I thought it was Warren! He's been blowing up my phone ever since I gave him my number..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_038="Not me. In fact, I was going to get a brand new phone..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_040="There is no "everybody"—there's only your friends and your family who love you."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_041="No, you're not. And I'm here for you..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_042="I fucked up and I'm sorry. Look, I'm here for you now."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_043="I do! Just step back and listen to me!"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_044="Kate, please trust me. Come stand by me, okay? I can help you now... I know I can."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_049="Kate, I'm gathering proof that Nathan Prescott drugged you. And you're not the only victim. So you have to help me take Nathan down."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_051="I wasn't sure what to do. There's been so much crazy shit going on, I... I can't even explain..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_052="Of course. Like I said this morning, I think Nathan is involved. I just need time to prove it. And I have a way with time..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_058="Kate, I believe you. Will you believe me?"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_059="Soon. Then straight to the police. Think of it like we're cleansing Blackwell..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_061="Good. We all need to have each other's backs. So I want you to come with me now..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_063="What about your mother, Kate? You'll destroy her. She doesn't care about a video. She loves you."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_064="Wait Kate, think about your brothers. They need their sister..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_065="Kate, I saw that card from your father. You can count on him, he clearly loves you without question."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_066="I saw that cute photo of you with your sisters in your room this morning. I can see how much your little sister loves you by her smile."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_070="See? You're not alone. And nobody down there wants to see you up here."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_072="Then make Lynn happy and step towards me. If she was here, you would know what to do."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_073="No! Kate, please stop... Listen..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_075="How does that Proverb go? "When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to the evildoers...""
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_076="Maybe I'm put here to help you, Kate. And maybe you're here to help me. You already have more than I can explain..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_077=""Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest...""
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_078="Suicide is a sin, isn't it? If you believe in Hell... you might end up there. I don't want that to happen..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_082="Believe it, Kate. Now come down with me..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_083="Kate, this will crush your father. You think he cares about a video? He loves you unconditionally..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_084="You told me about your sisters, especially the youngest one... What's her name?"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_086="This isn't the end, Kate. There's no way God doesn't have big plans for you here..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_088="Kate, stop... Let me talk to you..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_089="Nobody cares, Kate. There'll be another viral Victoria video in a day and everybody will forget."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_090="Kate, there are billions of videos out there. Yours will fade away like white noise."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_092="Once the truth comes out about how you were drugged, everybody will believe you."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_093="Kate, this is our chance to beat the bullies. That's the only way we can win against them."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_098="I understand, truly. I get bullied too! But this is a blip..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_100="Kate, if there's one thing I believe... it's exactly that. Now can we hug this out?"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_101="Forever. Can we hug on it?"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_102="Kate! You can't do this to all the people who care about you!"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_103="I know this is terrible for you, but like the good book says, this too shall pass..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_106="Brooke is your friend, isn't she?"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_107="I know that Alyssa believes you. Has she ever treated you any different than before?"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_108="Of course Stella believes you! She's never bought into this video bullshit!"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_109="What about Dana? She believes you..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_110="Like I said, I care about you. I know this passage means a lot to you."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_119="Don't worry Kate, things will get better. I promise."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_120="Like I helped by erasing all that crap people wrote on your room slate..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_122="I'll always be here for you Kate. My new motto is, "Friends come first.""
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_123="This morning I erased the weblink to the video... It was written on the shower room mirror..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_126="I care about you because I believe you were drugged. We will find out who did this and make them pay."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_127="Yes... I know I screwed up. I'm sorry, Kate."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_128="Wait, Kate! I am sorry!"
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_129="Please... you don't have to do this..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_131="I believe you Kate. But it's dangerous for both of us if I get involved now..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_132="I needed more time to investigate on my own first... but we have to be careful..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CHKate_Phase01_Max_135="Now I do. You're part of the reason why. If you come down with me, I can tell you more..."
Cue_E2_4C_CampusB_CommentingKate_IGE_Alyssa_050="I cannot believe this, Brooke..."

Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_Insertion_Principal_100="As principal of Blackwell Academy, I take my duties seriously. I take the well-being of every student more seriously. What happened today should never happen in a hall of wisdom and knowledge."

Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice02_Max_005="Bullshit! Something happened to her, and you know it. How about we talk about you waving a gun in the girls' bathroom—"
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice02_Max_060="I was afraid yesterday, but I have to tell the truth."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice02_Max_090="No, I'm not and that has nothing to do with Kate Marsh!"

Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice02_Nathan_006="Hey, that's total slander! I could sue you and this school so fast!|...I already have a personal lawyer."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice02_Nathan_040="Whatever. See you in court."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice02_Principal_010="Careful, Mr. Prescott. I have been told of this alleged gun incident. And I have to admit that the video in question was sent to me by multiple sources."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice02_Principal_030="And since Mr Prescott does appear prominently in the video and was responsible for the party, I have no choice but to suspend him until further notice."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice02_Principal_050="Wait, Max. You told me that nothing happened yesterday. Are you just making things up? How can I trust you?"
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice02_Principal_070="I do understand that."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice02_Principal_100="Please, everybody calm down."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Jefferson_030="Kate... Miss Marsh... has been very withdrawn lately. And I assume this awful video was the cause. I hated seeing the students laugh at her."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Jefferson_040="She told me Max was the only one who believed her, would take her calls and actually listen to her."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Jefferson_050="She was upset Miss Caulfield didn't return her calls. She felt rejected by the school..."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Jefferson_080="No, on the contrary. Max was right to bring this up. Now, I wanted to help, but I guess I was too late..."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Jefferson_100="Are you serious?"
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Jefferson_120="I understand. There are bigger things at stake than me. The life of a young girl for one..."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Jefferson_130="Maybe you should investigate other staff members? Max told me she knew things about Mr. Madsen..."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Max_010="I saw Mr. Jefferson talking to Kate right before our class... then she ran off crying..."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Max_070="You ass. She didn't ask for any of this..."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Nathan_060="She shouldn't have asked to be on video macking with some dudes..."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Principal_020="Mark, I do know that Miss Marsh has assisted you on class events."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Principal_090="Well now, this is problematic. The publicity is rising and perhaps... you shouldn't represent Blackwell at the "Everyday Heroes" contest in San Francisco..."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Principal_110="I am. We don't need any negative press about that event. And we need to involve the Academy in possible disciplinarian measures for you."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_MaxChoice03_Principal_140="Let Max speak for herself. Everything we talked about here will be looked into."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_PrinSoloEnd_Principal_010="All right, Miss Caulfield, please sign here to confirm what you've told us. I'll continue this investigation from there."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_PrinSoloEnd_Principal_030="Well, I think we know less now than when we started. We'll be assisting the police with further inquiries."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_PrinSoloEnd_Principal_040="As of this moment, I am canceling the Vortex Club party. I know students have worked hard on this, but... we have concerned parents calling every minute. We'll take no chances until this matter has been thoroughly vetted."
Cue_E2_5A_PrinOffice_PrinSoloEnd_Principal_050="I know this has been a stressful day...I wish I had the power to change it all for the better... so thank you, for coming in."

Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_010="I just... can't believe it. It's like it wasn't even real... Watching her drop like a weight...I really thought I could save her... like a superhero."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_030="My hand just reached out—"
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_050="Yeah, I sure made a big fucking difference. Maybe if more people cared...better people than me..."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_070="Warren, I screwed up today."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_090="I couldn't even believe it was happening. It was literally slow motion as I grabbed her hand... and then I could feel her grabbing mine..."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_110="Not quite. Look at me, I'm a mess."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_130="I'm still worried about Kate. She did try to kill herself. All over a video..."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_150="So you watched it?"
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_170="Warren, I don't mean to sound weird, but there's something ominous going on at Blackwell..."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_190="And I'm working on proof that Kate Marsh is connected to Rachel Amber... somehow. Along with Nathan and Mr. Madsen."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_210="What the hell is this..."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_230="Brrr... I do feel cold."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_250="That's sweet, thanks. I'm okay."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_260="The weather confirms this weird day. Feel that chill..."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_270="Talk about "chiaroscuro.""
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Max_290="I believe you, Warren... I'll believe anything this week..."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_020="Come on, Max. Do not for a second blame yourself. Kate was on that roof for her reasons, not yours."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_040="Stop it. You were the only one with balls enough to run to the roof. You were the only one who cared."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_060="You're the best person around—"
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_080="That makes no logical sense."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_100="Max, that was the greatest thing I've ever seen. Ever. You reached out, she reached out... Hugs, tears, applause... Like a superhero!"
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_120="You're glowing. Seriously. A human halo. I'm pretty sure you earned your wings today."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_140=""Viral" is the right word. Like a disease."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_160="Just one—and a half times..."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_180="Today proves that."
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_200="I'm not a big conspiracy guy, but I wouldn't doubt it. Nathan did scare me yesterday and Madsen is a straight-up dickhead. So... what do you think is really happening?"
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_220="Feel that temperature drop?"
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_240="Do you want my jacket?"
Cue_E2_6A_CampusA_Insertion_RTC_Warren_280="Max, there was no eclipse scheduled today... I would know. I would."

﻿[Diary]
Chara_Franks_A="I'll never forget Frank—if only because he's the first and last person I will ever aim a gun at. How did Chloe end up in this sketchy drug dealer's orbit? The weird thing is that when I first saw him threatening Chloe in the junkyard, I was more shocked how un-creepy he looked. I expected some try-hard gangster, but he looked more like a dumpster diving troll. Which I guess he kinda is since we were on his turf, testing out my rewind skills for Chloe's amusement."
Chara_Joyce_A="Talking to Joyce Price after five years was almost as intense as seeing Chloe again. Especially right back in "ye olde" Two Whales Diner. That clinking of silverware and the smell of sizzling bacon rewound me back to being a kid, hanging out there with my parents for breakfast. I remember her always smiling at Chloe, even in mischief. Doubt she smiles at her hijinks now, but they still banter like mother and daughter."
Chara_Joyce_B="I moved to Seattle so soon after William died that I never saw how it affected Joyce. I'm glad she's not pissed at me for being selfish and never looking back. I still remember the last time Chloe and I saw him alive. I wonder how often Joyce relives that day? That's the worst kind of rewind: one you can't control. But if I could go back to that moment... what would I do?"
Chara_Joyce_C="I can only imagine how Joyce ended up with David Madsen. Talk about opposites. You can tell she loves him—disturbing as that sounds. Maybe she just wanted a more structured life for herself... Obviously it didn't work out that way with Chloe. I hope they both treat her right. Joyce deserves the best."
E2_Page00_A="October 8"
E2_Page00_B="I woke up this morning a different person. Even if nobody knows yet. After yesterday's intense revelations with my rewind power and saving Chloe's life among the other cray cray (as Victoria might say say) events at Blackwell, I have to assume everything is different now. And I thought exposing my photos to the world was going to be hard."
E2_Page00_C="After Chloe dropped me off back at my dorm yesterday, I tried to find out more about that freak snowfall that happened when we were at the lighthouse, but the local meteorologists are stumped so far. I felt so jacked up that I pulled an all-nighter on time and physics research."
E2_Page01_A="Not being Warren I ended up knowing less about my situation than when I started... I don't really think that my tornado vision and the snowfall are connected, but at this point I have no fucking clue what to believe. I'm just so glad Chloe and I are a team again. That has to be destiny."
E2_Page01_B="Now I have to hit the showers and get ready to meet Chloe for breakfast. Lord knows I need it."
E2_Page01_C="I ran into Kate in the showers and she asked for "The October Country" back. I love that book and definitely need to get my own copy. Of course when I was in the shower, Victoria and Taylor barged in and totally started ragging on poor Kate about the video. Just to be complete assholes they wrote the link on the mirror."
E2_Page01_D="I truly don't understand how they get off on acting like that. Victoria has EVERYTHING. What does she gain by being a bully to Kate Marsh? We're supposed to be adults here, but I swear it's like "Battle Royale"—just without the dystopia and exploding heads. Only Victoria could make me feel dirty in a shower."
E2_Page02_A="The plot thickens. And I can't get out."
E2_Page02_B1="So after listening to Victoria and Taylor rag on Kate about the video, I came back to my room to find it TRASHED. Or at least messier than it was before."
E2_Page02_B2="So after listening to Victoria and Taylor rag on Kate about the video, I came back to my room to find this creepy photomontage. Only Nathan would be this disturbed."
E2_Page02_C1="Now I have to clean up just to find Kate's book... I bet Victoria did this because of that paint photo yesterday. I should've expected swift retribution. Another day, another drama..."
E2_Page02_C2="The thought that Nathan was in here actually setting up this weird gallery is way fucked up. I better start being more careful around here. I almost want a surveillance system now..."
E2_Page02_D="After being forced to listen to Victoria and Taylor rag on Kate about the video, I headed back to my room. I didn't really have any time to chill out, I had to get dressed and find Kate's book in my own mess, rushing all the while to not be late for Chloe."
E2_Page02_F="As if things here weren't dramatic enough, I got a creepy text from a private number. Nathan? Victoria? No clue. I really have to start watching my back."
E2_Page02_G="I still had to give Kate's book back, so I went to her room. I knew she wasn't doing good, but I didn't know how bad until I went in. All the lights were off, blinds closed, like some emo-goth den. And Kate is the opposite of emo or goth. She was just crying in the dark, and it was so sad to see her like this. More sad is that I wished I could take a picture of her framed in her expressionist misery."
E2_Page03_A="Kate admitted that she thinks something more happened to her than just a video. Plus she told me that Nathan Prescott gave her a ride from the party to the ER... and she thinks he did something to her, but she doesn't remember what."
E2_Page03_B="It's hard not to believe Kate considering what kind of person she is and what kind of person Nathan is. I've seen for myself exactly what that fucker is capable of."
E2_Page03_C="Of course, Kate asked if she should go to the police and the principal..."
E2_Page03_D1="I told Kate she should absolutely go to them. Other people could be in danger... But Kate also said she would use me as her backup, which kind of scares me because of this text threat. Should I be getting this involved when somebody is obviously stalking me or worse already? This is getting freakier than I can handle... Super Max... NOT!"
E2_Page03_D2="I felt like absolute shit, but I told Kate she shouldn't go to anybody until she has more proof she was drugged. That video doesn't help her case at all and this could all backfire big time. She's going up against the whole Prescott empire, not just one rich white boy on dope. She wasn't too thrilled by my answer. I don't think she trusts me to be the one investigating all this... How can I blame her? I sometimes wonder what I am actually doing, besides getting myself in more trouble... Kate even booted me out of her room. Hello, "Everyday Hero"!"
E2_Page04_A="I ran into Warren—or rather, Warren was waiting to run into me. Naturally he wanted to know what the hell happened in the parking lot with "The Chloe and Nathan Show." Once again, I felt like a dick because I should have gotten ahold of Warren to see if he was okay after we just left him in the lot... I do owe Warren."
E2_Page04_B="I only told him a little about what was going on with Nathan. The less he knows, the better for him. I would love to at least tell him about my ability to fucking reverse time and space, but ironically I don't think it's the right time or space... Besides, he would want to marry me immediately, just so he could have his own human time machine. Or capture me for scientific experiments... Or make me go to the drive-in with him."
E2_Page04_C="Oh wait... I did say I would go to the drive-in with him. Hope he doesn't make a lame move on me... (Not that he would, egomaniac.) Warren and I do have a lot in common, but he's like a supercool geek brother... Anyway, I definitely need a movie escape."
E2_Page04_D="Oh wait. He did try and get me to go to the drive-in with him, and I refused. I'm not really in the mood this week, and I also don't want to lead him on..."
E2_Page05_A="Before catching the bus out to meet Chloe I saw Nathan talking to David, which made me nervous. Otherwise I had a nice soundtracked ride to the Two Whales Diner. Talk about going back in time... I haven't seen the diner in five years, but it looks exactly the same. Although now there are way less fishermen and way more dumped food carts than when we were kids. Chloe and I had the best backdrop to play pirate: old ships and a big ocean."
E2_Page05_B="Chloe was late (duh!) so I was happy to be distracted by seeing Joyce again. The diner is like a museum piece, except with customers. Better still, the food hasn't changed at all. Joyce seemed really glad to see me again and she didn't give me a \nguilt trip for not staying in touch. After William died, she wanted to move forward with a new life and husband. Chloe doesn't want to accept that."
E2_Page05_C1="Joyce naturally gave me shit for corrupting Chloe with my "devil weed", though I'm not sure she even believed it was mine. What could I say? I can see she actually loves David—even if I don't see how. The breakfast was so worth the grief though."
E2_Page05_C2="Joyce wasn't happy about Chloe getting busted with weed. I really should have stepped up and taken the hit instead of Chloe. I feel bad that Joyce has to defend David for laying the smackdown on his own stepdaughter. William was always so kind and gentle with us. Can't even imagine how Chloe would be if he hadn't died."
E2_Page06_A="So much drama and I haven't even finished my breakfast!"
E2_Page06_B="Finally Chloe showed up, more bubbly than I would have thought after almost getting killed in a bathroom yesterday. It makes me happy to see her smile. But that smile meant trouble, since all she really wanted was for me to show off my rewind power. So I did and I have to admit, I felt like a total boss. Except I did start feeling weak and woozy the more I rewound. I even got a nosebleed, which kinda freaked me out."
E2_Page06_C="Chloe always wants more, so she demanded we go to her top-secret lair..."
E2_Page06_D1="She still had to get pissed off at me because I dared to answer Kate's call. I'm not a fan of Chloe's petulant side. She tried to make me feel like an ass, but screw that. Kate was so happy I answered I actually felt worse for her. Chloe has to know I can have two friends at once..."
E2_Page06_D2="Kate called, but I didn't answer because Chloe was giving me the stink eye. And to be honest, I don't like Kate being so needy toward me. Even though I keep acting like I'm her spiritual bodyguard. Man, I do suck. I'll make it up to Kate. At least Chloe is happy..."
E2_Page07_A="Just when I thought shit couldn't get crazier."
E2_Page07_B="Chloe took me to her secret lair: the city dump. Perfect for Halloween... like where the vehicle and appliance ghosts of Arcadia Bay come to rot and rust. Urban dystopia porn. But, instead of taking cool photos, Chloe had me do some silly kinda fun gun tricks."
E2_Page07_C="Until the guy Chloe owes money to showed up. Some skeevy guy called Frank. He demanded Chloe pay him back... or else. I was shocked that he wasn't the loan shark I had expected, but I could literally feel his bad vibe. I still can't see how my best friend ended up involved with a loser like Frank."
E2_Page07_D="And I almost shot him."
E2_Page07_E1="He pulled a knife on us and it felt like another one of my dreams. I don't even remember aiming the gun at him, but my finger just tapped against the trigger... Thank God there were no bullets left. I could have used my rewind, but the way my head was throbbing... who knows? I can't assume my power will always be available... I don't know anything about how this works—or how long—so I can't take anything for granted. I just know I'm never holding another gun."
E2_Page07_E2="Things got truly crazy when Frank took Chloe's gun (or should I say David's gun?) and now we have to worry about one more lunatic after Chloe... and maybe me...\n\nChloe really flipped out when she saw that Frank was wearing one of Rachel Amber's bracelets. That means we definitely have another suspect...\n\nThis is so not how I intended to spend my time back in Arcadia Bay."
E2_Page08_A="After all that dramarama volume xxxiii, Chloe and I ended up taking a walk along the tracks deep in the woods. We both needed to hear nothing but the sounds of nature and wildlife... I was shaking inside from our encounter with Frank and though Chloe fronts tough, I could tell she was shaken too."
E2_Page08_B="She told me everything about Frank—which explains why she was trying to blackmail Nathan. It shocks me that the girl I grew up with watching "SpongeBob" ended up in such a scary orbit. Still, I felt safer with her at my side and I was glad we had a moment of peace."
E2_Page08_C="So it probably wasn't the best idea to lay down on the tracks and wax about life, etc.—as Chloe's leg got caught in the rail just as the goddamn train showed up. Of course I was off trying to take a photo for my portfolio... and then I had another quick flash of my tornado vision."
E2_Page08_D="I could see it, almost feel it, tearing the sky apart... My head felt like it was exploding, like in that 80's film "Scanners." Just as fast as the vision came in, it disappeared. I may be in denial about what this apocalyptic image means... or doesn't..."
E2_Page09_A="Then I heard Chloe SCREAMING for help. And I was shittin' kittens."
E2_Page09_B="Her foot was stuck in the damn rail and naturally the train was comin' round the mountain."
E2_Page09_C="I was pretty proud of myself for coming up with a drastic (if not destructive) solution to saving Chloe—ONCE AGAIN—but just in case this journal ever falls into the wrong hands, it's going to remain our BFF secret. So there."
E2_Page09_D="Our morning adventure over, Chloe dropped me off back at my campus. She was so sweet and said that this had been the best week of her life... despite everything."
E2_Page09_E="That made me feel so AWESOME! Chloe really sees us like we're taking over the world... but what if I hadn't had been able to use my rewind power to get her off of the tracks? Chloe might have to lower her expectations... and so will I."
E2_Page10_A1="Speaking of expectations, David Madsen stopped to talk to me without being a total prick. I thought he was going to bust me for taking the heat for Chloe's weed, but we just talked a little... and for the first time, I felt kind of sorry for David. He is a veteran... I know he probably saw awful things in combat. He said he doesn't want to fight with Chloe or me. But all the shit he's pulled and treating Kate like she's a suspect... just makes it hard to get along. But I promise to try. For world peace."
E2_Page10_A2="Speaking of expectations, David Madsen talked to me without being a total prick. I wanted to tear him a new one for hitting Chloe (thinking I could rewind if things got out of control) and he didn't seem sufficiently sorry to me. I know Chloe provokes him, but that's no fucking excuse to hit someone, especially a family member. I see that David is sorry and trying to reach out to me. I know he saw terrible things in combat. I just can't trust him and his paranoid surveillance fetish, especially with how weird he acts with Kate—like she's a criminal. I'll give David props for trying to smoke the peace pipe with me, but he acts like he's still at war."
E2_Page10_B="Something odd happened—as if EVERYTHING happening isn't bizarro—but I saw Kate having an intense conversation with Mr. Jefferson and she ended up practically running away from him in tears. I wish I could have casually asked, "Oh by the way, what's up with Kate?" (Like he would tell me anyway.) I know Kate treats Jefferson like he's an apostle or something... So what did he say to make her so upset?"
E2_Page10_C="Just when I was feeling good about Chloe and me, I walk into Jefferson's class and see Nathan and Victoria actually sitting on my desk. Unreal... Asshole bookends."
E2_Page11_A1="Kate Marsh killed herself."
E2_Page11_A2="Kate Marsh almost killed herself."
E2_Page11_B="My hands are still shaking, but I have to write this down while I can. Right at the start of Jefferson's class, Kate went to the roof of the girls' dorm to jump. Every student and teacher was watching her, like it was a Blackwell rooftop concert."
E2_Page11_C="I saw her actually jump, but I was just about able to use my rewind to get her back on the roof. I tried harder than I ever did and somehow I stopped time completely... I made it to the roof, but again my head felt like it was going to blow up... I knew that I couldn't just keep rewinding to save Kate. I had to try and talk her down on my own."
E2_Page11_D="I failed..."
E2_Page11_E1="She was already in so much pain over the video and all the bullying, so she wasn't going to buy everything I tried to tell her. You see movies with people trying to talk somebody out of suicide but it's very different when I'm the one doing the talking. Because she didn't believe me... or maybe she just didn't want to."
E2_Page11_E2="She was already in so much pain over the video and all the bullying, so she wasn't going to buy everything I tried to tell her. You see movies with people trying to talk somebody out of suicide, but it's very different when I'm the one doing the talking. I covered everything I could and Kate almost jumped anyway. Cliché or not, I told her how much her friends and family love her, even if they don't all show it now."
E2_Page11_F1="I... I tried. Kate still died."
E2_Page11_F2="Lo and behold, Kate stepped back from the ledge. Alive. I almost cried in her arms."
E2_Page12_A1="It was like that cliché about everything moving in slow motion, except in my case it was real time, not rewind time. I could see Kate's face right as she jumped and I'll never forget that look in her eyes... like she didn't want to, but had no choice..."
E2_Page12_A2="I know this isn't about me—though I have to admit it was an amazing feeling to walk arm in arm with Kate from the roof to outside the dorm. Like I said, the whole school—and police—were watching us almost completely silent. Then I heard what sounded like Logan yelling out, "Give it up for Max!" and everybody started to clap and cheer. Talk about surreal... the people who ignored me or treated me like crap suddenly crushing on me. That might be the strangest thing that's happened to me this insane week..."
E2_Page12_B1="It was a look of total defeat and despair... Then I could see her body flailing in space, like she became aware of what she was doing and got more scared..."
E2_Page12_B2="And that made me wonder if Victoria was watching and how she felt about all this. I almost wanted to find her... just to get in her smug face for enabling Kate's suicide attempt. Such cruel bullshit. Though, to be fair, Victoria wasn't the only one that was responsible... Nathan Prescott seemed to have disappeared... Which was probably a good thing."
E2_Page12_C1="Jesus. I can't believe I'm writing these words."
E2_Page12_C2="And after all that I still had to talk to the police and give a statement. Felt so weird to do since I've seen it in pretty much every police procedural show. I had to lie my ass off when he questioned me about the other students, because I just don't think the police are ever going to find out what happened. Yes, this looks like a job for SUPER MAX. Right. Though of course, I do love it when Chloe calls me that, even if I don't feel that everyday heroic for helping Kate down... Maybe it's wrong for me to think I have to feel anything but grateful that Kate didn't jump..."
E2_Page12_D="After she jumped, it was so weird that I was alone on the roof. Kate was there, then gone. I could hear the crowd screaming below and there was no way I was going to look at her body on the ground."
E2_Page12_E="I felt so numb, I just casually turned and went back down the stairs. My head was pounding and my body was exhausted from the rewind. I felt exactly like a zombie must feel: dead inside."
E2_Page13_A="When I stepped out of the dorm, I saw Kate splayed on the ground... She was surrounded by paramedics, while the police kept the students back..."
E2_Page13_B="I hope they all got a good look at their victim. They wanted to watch her on a viral video when she was alive and now they wanted to gawk at her in death... Not that I did anything to help her stay alive."
E2_Page13_C="All my amazing new superpowers were worthless."
E2_Page13_D="I'm nobody's hero."
E2_Page13_E="What was really odd was when all the students and faculty staff surrounded me and Kate, then started patting our backs and shoulders... like we were heroes."
E2_Page13_F="I wasn't sure how to respond, considering Kate almost threw herself off the roof because of everybody at school. But like I said, I can't blame everybody... and I still don't really know where to point all my fingers..."
E2_Page13_G="The very best thing was that even though Kate was still in tears and confused... I definitely saw her smile once she realized how happy everybody was that she was alive. I smiled too. The police and paramedics swooped in and then Kate was covered in a blanket and gently escorted to the ambulance. They didn't thank me or look at me like I was a hero. I guess they're used to saving people without applause..."
E2_Page13_H="But if I'm super honest... it felt pretty cool. Like I got a hug from the whole school. So, maybe Blackwell Academy isn't totally bad..."
E2_Page14_A1="It's not enough that Kate is dead and I'm numb inside, I had to get the Blackwell third-degree from Principal Wells. It was bizarre to be in his tacky office with Nathan Prescott, David Madsen and Mr. Jefferson calmly talking about why Kate jumped off the roof. Part of me wanted to smash Nathan's smug face against the desk, knowing he had something to do with Kate's suicide. I thought about doing it, then flipping a quick rewind, but I knew that would be the start of a bad, dangerous habit."
E2_Page14_A2="Fortunately, Principal Wells amazingly did the right thing and BOOTED Nathan for a few days, after I told him what happened in the bathroom. He must have more shit on Nathan, because otherwise I doubt this would happen to a Prescott. That's some small justice for Kate. There'll be more, if it's the last thing I do. Which it could be if I'm not careful..."
E2_Page14_A3="I should have known that David would narc on me to the Principal about my "joint." Like anybody cares about weed, but David made me sound like a drooling fiend. So instead of Nathan getting the boot, I get suspended. Such BULLSHIT."
E2_Page14_B1="It's not enough that Kate is dead and I'm numb inside, I had to get the Blackwell third-degree from Principal Wells. It was bizarre to be in his tacky office with Nathan Prescott, David Madsen and Mr. Jefferson calmly talking about why Kate jumped off the roof. Of course, I was in a quiet rage. Until I told Principal Wells that I saw David harassing Kate. That set David off and part of me wanted to kick him in the balls knowing he had something to do with Kate's suicide, maybe more. I thought about doing it, then flipping a quick rewind, but I knew that would be the start of a bad, dangerous habit."
E2_Page14_B2="I took silent satisfaction in watching the Principal strip him of his Blackwell duties for the time being. I wasn't even thinking how this would affect Chloe's home situation..."
E2_Page14_B3="But for now, David is going to be a veteran of Blackwell. At least he survived. Unlike Kate."
E2_Page14_C1="It's not enough that Kate is dead and I'm numb inside, I had to get the Blackwell third-degree from Principal Wells. It was bizarre to be in his tacky office with Nathan Prescott, David Madsen and Mr. Jefferson calmly talking about why Kate jumped off the roof. I was like a robot, just going through the motions. I kept seeing Kate's face as she fell... And then I told the Principal about David harassing Kate, which sent him into a rage. I should have known that David would actually accuse me of dealing weed. Yes, who wouldn't believe I carry oz's on me for the schoolkids? I couldn't believe that the Principal would take him at his word, but he sure did."
E2_Page14_C2="So naturally I GOT SUSPENDED. That's what I get for standing up for Chloe."
E2_Page14_C3="Whatever. Poor Kate Marsh is part of Blackwell's concrete and the school has to purge itself by making sure Maxine Caulfield misses art and science class. What a lesson. My parents will be so proud and happy they sent me here. If this is how the adult world functions, maybe I don't belong. Even my so-called "power" doesn't mean shit anymore."
E2_Page14_C4="I already see how the world treated Kate. And I'm starting to see why Rachel Amber wanted to get the hell out of here now. What's keeping me here?"
E2_Page14_D1="It's not enough that Kate is dead and I'm numb inside, I had to get the Blackwell third-degree from Principal Wells.

I kept seeing Kate's face as she fell... Somehow I ended up telling the Principal that I had seen Kate crying after she talked with Mr. Jefferson... I wasn't trying to blame him, I just thought it was important information."
E2_Page14_D2="Maybe I fucked up, narcing on the one person I respect the most at Blackwell... I could see Mr. Jefferson was disappointed in me too. Obviously the Principal was more upset, because he pulled Jefferson out from representing the school at the "Everyday Heroes" contest. I didn't expect that at all. I'm so confused right now... How can I keep going to Mr. Jefferson's class after I ruined his reputation?"
E2_Page14_D3="And do I still have to give him a photo for the contest?"
E2_Page14_E1="It's not enough that Kate is alive, and though I'm not enough of an egomaniac to take the credit, I still had to get the Blackwell third-degree from Principal Wells. It was bizarre to be in his tacky office with Nathan Prescott, David Madsen and Mr. Jefferson calmly talking about why Kate would attempt suicide. I was quiet but giddy inside, just replaying in my head the moment when Kate stepped toward me with a glimmer of hope in her eyes... Part of me wanted to smash Nathan's smug face against the desk, knowing he had a lot to do with Kate's suicide attempt.

E2_Page14_H3="And do I still have to give him a photo for the contest?"
E2_Page14_I1="It's not enough that Kate is dead and I'm numb inside, I had to get the Blackwell third-degree from Principal Wells. It was bizarre to be in his tacky office with Nathan Prescott, David Madsen and Mr. Jefferson calmly talking about why Kate jumped off the roof. Of course, I was in a quiet rage. Until I told Principal Wells that I saw David harassing Kate. That set David off and part of me wanted to kick him in the balls knowing he had something to do with Kate's suicide, maybe more. I thought about doing it, then flipping a quick rewind, but I knew that would be the start of a bad, dangerous habit."
E2_Page14_I2="Naturally, the Principal didn't believe me (or didn't want to), which means that David Dickhead is going to be allowed to harass other students at Blackwell until they jump off the roof."
E2_Page14_I3="So Kate Marsh is dead and it's business as usual here. I hate this fucking school right now."
E2_Page14_J1="It's not enough that Kate is alive, and though I'm not enough of an egomaniac to take the credit, I still had to get the Blackwell third-degree from Principal Wells. It was bizarre to be in his tacky office with Nathan Prescott, David Madsen and Mr. Jefferson calmly talking about why Kate would attempt suicide. I was quiet but giddy inside, just rewinding in my head the moment when Kate stepped towards me with hope in her eyes, not fear.... Until I told Principal Wells that I saw David harassing Kate. That set David off and part of me wanted to kick him in the balls knowing he had something to do with Kate's suicide, maybe more. I thought about doing it, then flipping a quick rewind, but I knew that would be the start of a bad, dangerous habit."
E2_Page14_J2="Naturally, the Principal didn't believe me (or didn't want to), which means that David Dickhead is going to be allowed to harass other students at Blackwell until they try to jump off the roof."
E2_Page14_J3="So Kate Marsh is in the hospital and it's business as usual here. What am I going to do now?"
E2_Page15_A1="I need a vacation from my life. I hung out with Warren on the lawn so I could feel grass under my feet and watch the fluffy clouds. He's such a sweetheart, he kept telling me I did everything I could for Kate. Even though I know I didn't..."
E2_Page15_A2="I told Warren that something ominous is happening at Blackwell Academy. Rachel Amber, Chloe and now Kate have all been victims. Not to mention me, if I keep playing amateur detective. Wish I could have told Warren about my power, but it's not the right time... No pun intended."
E2_Page15_A3="And to make the day end on the most surreal note possible, the sky went dark and we watched a solar eclipse that was not announced on the news or any astronomy site."
E2_Page15_A4="What is happening to Arcadia Bay?"
E2_Page15_B1="After being grilled in the principal's den, I hung out with Warren on the lawn so I could feel grass under my feet and watch the fluffy clouds. He's such a sweetheart, he kept telling me how proud he was that I stopped Kate from jumping. I don't believe that I did, but I have to say it's better to be treated like a hero at school than like a twee loser."
E2_Page15_B2="Still, I told Warren that something ominous is happening at Blackwell Academy. Rachel Amber, Chloe and now Kate have all been victims. Not to mention me, if I keep playing amateur detective. Wish I could have let Warren know about my power, but it's not the right time... as if anything is the right time anymore."
E2_Page15_B3="And to make the day end on the most surreal note possible, the sky went dark and we watched a solar eclipse that was not announced on the news or any astronomy site."

E2_1A_MaxRoom_MaxLaptop_SP01="JOIN THE CHRONONAUTS!\n\nTime travel is not just a science fiction\n\nHistory has recorded numerous cases of individuals who have managed to bend all rules of the time-space continuum. The present dilemma is that those who can navigate temporal dimensions are rightly reluctant to reveal themselves due to the impact of public and government scrutiny. Nations around the world have spent literally billions of dollars trying to build (in top secret) their own version of a "time machine"—thankfully, this is not a case where infinite revenue equals control of the infinite. Or you might not be reading this website at all.\n\nThis is where The Chrononauts enter the picture. \n\nIt's clear based on the vast scientific information that time travel is only applicable on a PERSON BY PERSON basis, not driven nor dominated by any one particular physics or thermodynamic calibration. For this reason, we have created a forum where past, present and future time travelers can share tips, ideas and experiences to guide those navigating the rocky seas of time. Hence our moniker, The Chrononauts—brave solitary adventurers on an infinite voyage. \n\nRegister within the forum and step into a river of time without fear of being swept away!"
E2_1A_MaxRoom_MaxLaptop_SP02="WORMHOLE!\n\nWelcome to the wonderful world of the Wormhole\n\nA term lazily over-exploited in science and science fiction.\nFor neophytes, visualize a wormhole like an invisible tunnel from one end of space to another. Thus, if wormholes exist, time travel is possible and probable.\n\nThe human trick is to discover the means or device needed to link and traverse both ends of this time tunnel. Einstein's theory of relativity posits that this is within the realm of theory, while a new generation of physicists hopes to develop an actual working model of this fascinating space-time conundrum. \n\nInside WORMHOLE! are links and articles relating to the most recent developments of this fluid theory."
E2_1A_MaxRoom_MaxLaptop_SP03="Why Are Quantum Physicists Trying To Control Time?\n\nAs you read these words, physicists and scientists around the world are using taxpayer funded government programs to shatter our notions of time and space, potentially altering the course of history itself.\n\nFor example, Australian researchers are using photons to simulate quantum particles as they travel through time itself. Even though quantum time mechanics is a very recent theory first predicted in 1991, it has caught fire within the scientific community, who eliminated ethics and morality from their dangerous experiments."
E2_1A_MaxRoom_MaxLaptop_SP04="Too Much Time\nHey Max. The Doctor is in da house!\nI've been thinking long and hard about your weird request. I just sent you a bunch of physics and science links and without further ado, here's a few time travel films you must see. I'll send more as they come to mind. The Doctor expects a full explanation for your newfound chrono-interest. \n\nTHE TIME MACHINE – The 1960 version. Fun early steampunk sci-fi. And Morlock's faces melt.\nPRIMER – Lo-fi time travelers in Dallas. Brilliant. I'll explain it to you after you watch it.\nTIME AFTER TIME – H.G. Wells uses his time machine to chase Jack The Ripper to modern day San Francisco. Supercool and clever.\nPULP FICTION – Serious. The switching between timelines gives a good basic outline of relativity. Plus Uma.\nSOMEWHERE IN TIME – Big cult around this romantic sci-fi written by Richard Matheson. The best kind of chick flick. You'll cry like a baby. I did.\nTIME SLIP – You can borrow my copy of this awesome Japanese flick. Or we can watch it together. Sonny Chiba and his soldiers end up back in samurai days. Basically tanks versus ninjas. \nTIMECOP – Jean Claude Van Damme does the splits on a kitchen counter in his underwear. Need I say more?\n\nThat's all the TIME I have now as I do have actual quantum physics to plow through. And not your "fun" Back To The Future homework that I NEVER GET. Now that you've discovered the art of science, I expect to see you in the lab more as well. I could always use a new partner in TIME. Get it? \n\nDon't hit, I'm leaving.\nDr. Who?"

Cue_E3_2A_Corridor_PrincipalLocked_Chloe_030="Well, now we definitely have to get this door open. Believe it or not, I know a little about lock picking—thanks to Frank. I might as well test out my thief skill..."

Cue_E3_2A_Corridor_PrincipalLocked_Chloe_080="Guess I didn't spend enough time with Frank. But I'll use my DIY lock-pick tools while you come up with a better plan."

Cue_E3_2A_Corridor_RachelFile_Chloe_040="Nathan accuses Rachel of bringing drugs on campus? And my step-troll went along because he thinks Rachel was a bad influence on me. Assholes."
Cue_E3_2A_Corridor_RachelFile_Chloe_060=""Nathan Prescott the Third." Oooh, he's so money. And you know the Prescotts dropped major bank to bury Nathan's real file... Look, it reads like a rap sheet—bad grades, teacher complaints, secret probation... But I was expelled?"
Cue_E3_2A_Corridor_RachelFile_Chloe_090="That's just some crazy drawing..."
Cue_E3_2A_Corridor_RachelFile_Chloe_110="That's... fucked up. What does this even mean? Nathan is truly psychotic. I know he has something to do with Rachel missing..."

Cue_E3_2A_Corridor_RachelFile_Chloe_150="Oh, we are so going into his garage files... Plus I'm getting a little paranoid in here. We got our info, let's bail. But maybe we shouldn't leave without a gift..."
Cue_E3_2A_Corridor_RachelFile_Chloe_180="Max, do your powers include mind-reading? Or did you just rewind because I tried to steal the chair? Shit, I'm confused."
Cue_E3_2A_Corridor_RachelFile_Max_050="If David is teaming up with Nathan Prescott... That's a bad sign."
Cue_E3_2A_Corridor_RachelFile_Max_070="At least Nathan was finally suspended. Check out that note... Open it."

Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_DefendDavid_Max_010="Listen, we don't know that David did anything and nobody has any proof against him. As far as we know, it's Nathan Prescott who's the real threat so far. I would cut David slack here..."
Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_FamilyArgues_Chloe_190="He threatens them with surveillance cameras. So he can spy on everybody... like he spies on all of us here."

Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_FamilyArgues_Chloe_230="You used to call me a loser for getting kicked out of Blackwell... So who's the loser now, David? Who haven't you accused or harassed? Between your investigations into Rachel and Kate, what have you done besides get in trouble?"

Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_FamilyArgues_David_060="Well, now it's the last time. I'll get a lawyer to sue their ass."
Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_FamilyArgues_David_065="Figures you'd be here. Is that your Rachel Amber Halloween costume?"
Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_FamilyArgues_David_080="No, you and Chloe think you know more than anybody. Like all teenagers."

Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_FamilyArgues_Joyce_090="Leave Max alone, David. I can't believe you got fired—no, of course I can believe you got fired. Did you threaten some poor student with the stockade?"
Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_FamilyArgues_Joyce_130="Do you know for sure it was Blackwell students?"
Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_FamilyArgues_Joyce_180="Leave Max alone, David. Stop threatening students."

Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_Insertion_Joyce_040="I thought you would have missed those. You ate more than William, and he loved them..."

Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_MaxSits_Joyce_130="I didn't show you this to be morbid. In fact, I want you to have this... This was when my baby was so full of life and light. She was hopeful, positive... everything she's not today. And this was the last time I ever saw Chloe truly happy."
Cue_E3_5B_LivingRoom_MaxSits_Max_010="Thank you so much, Joyce. I'm never leaving this table."

Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_QPhase03_Alyssa_001="Don't beat yourself up. A lot of people are very proud of you."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_002="Thanks Max, I wish you could have helped me the other day when I got tagged by a football and toilet paper."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_003="That's the second time you've saved me, Max! Thanks!"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_004="Okay Max, this is the third time you saved me from harm's way. You must be my angel."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_007="You've paid your dues by saving Kate's life on the roof. You really are a Blackwell hero, Max."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_008="I saw you try to save my friend Kate on that roof. The only one who did... While people took camera pics."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_016="It's fucked up. But you're an amazing friend. I want to make sure she knows how many friends she really has from now on."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_017="Well, she didn't because she had a friend who cared enough to help. I hope everybody at Blackwell starts caring..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_018="Well, we're all glad you did. I'm sure it was a strain on you."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_020="No way! That is total bullshit! Wow, maybe we should get a petition going..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_021="Max, we should get a posse to see her in the hospital when they allow visitors. Let's hang later and talk some more."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_022="Yes, you sure were. And you know it. Okay, I have to get going... See you later, Max."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_023="Maybe we could take a picture to Kate as a gift... Hey, I have to go, but let's talk later."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_028="Everybody saw that. I'm proud of you for being so brave. You're pretty cool, Max."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_029="Knock that shit off. The whole school saw you trying to talk her down. But nobody could have... You're still a hero, Max."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_030="Well, it's hard to be strong when an entire school and internet is bullying you."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_031="No way! That is total bullshit! Wow, maybe we should get a petition going..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_035="We need to hang out more, drink some wine... I have to go but let's talk later, cool?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Alyssa_036="But she didn't. We can't go back and fix her now, Max. I'll see you later."

Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_006="Don't thank me. I haven't done anything special."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_009="I'm just glad she came down. Kate's a good person... my friend. And she was almost bullied to death by a video."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_010="No, I'm just lucky. If Kate wanted to jump, she could have..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_011="True. I mean, nobody else was stepping up to help her. I didn't even think about it."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_012="I'm such a hero that Principal Wells suspended me... thanks to David Madsen and the Prescotts..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_013="Amen to that."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_014="Obviously, Kate too. I was just the conduit to save—help her."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_015="No worries. It's done. Besides, now I have an excuse to take a lot of photos this week."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_024="Kate was my friend too. I would have done anything to save her."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_025="Yep, I tried... and Kate died."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_026="Kate was too scared to stand up for herself. I wish she would have listened to me... She wasn't strong enough."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_027="I'm such a hero that Principal Wells suspended me... thanks to David Madsen and the Prescotts..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_032="That's not how I feel today, but thanks."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_033="Maybe she could have..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHAlyssa_Thanks_Max_034="Fuck it. I'm kind of over Blackwell at the moment."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman02_002="Don't ask. First the snow, then an eclipse... What's next, a tornado?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman02_007="The climate sure has changed around here. Just saw that Prescott brat having a fit by himself in the parking lot..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman02_008="I'm a fisherman, no scientist. I know the sea is warming but this is something new... and maybe worse."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman02_009="He ain't the only one. If you knew what was going on with the fish around Arcadia Bay... Sorry, I'm too pissed to talk about it. See ya around, kid."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman02_010="If you knew what was going on with the fish around Arcadia Bay... Sorry, I'm too salty to talk about it. See ya around, kid."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman02_012="Could be worse, we could get one of those California quakes."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman02_013="I better... too late to switch careers now. See ya around, kid."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman02_015="Well, since you mentioned it first... There ain't no fish in Arcadia Bay!"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman02_017="None worth catching and eating anymore... I'm not shitting you. Salmon, trout, bass have died and migrated. Even the damn clams are dying..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Fisherman02_019="Sorry, I'm too salty to talk about it. See ya around, kid."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_001="Good morning! How are the fish today?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_003="You don't think it could be like climate change or something?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_004="I hope not..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_005="I heard that something bad was happening to the fish in Arcadia Bay..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_006="Isn't he always having a fit?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_011="What do you mean "worse"?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_014="True... well, I'm feeling a little dizzy now. Hope you catch the big one today!"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_016="What? Come on... None?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_Phase01_Max_018="Oh my God... but what about..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_QuickPhase01_Fisherman02_001="Like I said, I'm done talking about this..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHFisherman_QuickPhase02_Fisherman02_001="Can't chat now, gotta focus on the fish."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_002="I remember you..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_003="Well, I'm homeless. Otherwise, yeah, fantastic. Who are you?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_005="I heard about that girl killing herself at Blackwell... awful thing."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_006="I heard about that girl almost jumping off the Blackwell roof..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_012="Oh honey, that was her choice, not yours. Don't you carry that weight."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_013="That was you? If I had a bottle, cheers."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_014="A lot of things in Arcadia Bay are connected to Rachel..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_015="Maybe you're better off."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_016="It's a sad world, Max."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_021="But you're so damn young. Oh, if I could go back and be your age again..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_022="The more power you think you have, the less you do."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_023="Especially when it comes to other people..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_024="Kate Marsh probably felt like she had nothing no more... I know the feeling."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_027="You did the last time you talked to me... Now you look like you could do with help of your own."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_029="You look like you could do with help of your own."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_031="I'm probably a bigger snoop than you. People pretend to not see me, so I see everybody. And everything."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_036="That spoiled shit finally got kicked out of his daddy's school..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_037="That spoiled shit just has a bad aura, as we used to say..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_038="I saw him today looking more jumpy than usual..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_039="I heard him bragging that he took a gun from some trespassers."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_043="I saw him yesterday walking around, pissed off more than usual..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_044="He's an uptight ass but I think he just wants something to do."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_047="Sounds like you know a lot more than me, child."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_050="Maybe you'd like to tell me what you're hiding?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_053="Too late for me to judge anybody. Plus you're not crazy."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_054="If you don't want to share, you don't have to. I'm just an old homeless woman."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_056="Could be. Bad mojo is in the air this week. Thanks for the warning, Max."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_HomelessWoman_057="A warning... once you decide to tell me what you know."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_001="Hi, how are you?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_004="Max. Can I get you something from the diner?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_007="Kate Marsh. I was with her... when she jumped... I tried to save her. I swear I did."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_008="Kate Marsh. I was able to actually talk her down from the roof..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_009="I think it's all connected to Rachel Amber's disappearance."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_010="It's been a sad week. Doesn't even matter that I got expelled from Blackwell..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_011="It's been a sad week at Blackwell..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_017="Too late... and I had the power to change things."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_018="I know... I'm starting to see that I can't change everything..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_019="Thanks. Still didn't stop me from getting expelled from Blackwell."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_020="Thanks. Wish I had a bottle for you."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_025="But I need to find out who else is involved in this."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_026="I truly wish I could help you."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_030="Just to find some answers..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_032="Frank Bowers knew Rachel... Have you seen him around?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_033="Including Nathan Prescott?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_034="I think Joyce's husband, David, has something to do with all this."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_035="I'm just going to say this—I had a vision of Arcadia Bay being destroyed by a tornado... for real."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_040="I don't know how he hasn't been arrested yet."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_041="He also drugged the girl who jumped."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_042="He also drugged the girl who tried to jump..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_045="Because I basically got him kicked out of Blackwell."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_046="Like make life hell for me and his family?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_048="I just think Arcadia Bay is in trouble..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_051="I feel like I can trust you as much as Chloe... and you wouldn't think I'm crazy."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_052="There's nothing to tell..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_Phase01_Max_055="Please let me know if you need anything."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_QuickPhase01_HomelessWoman_001="Thanks for that storm warning, Max. And I'll let you know if I find out anything."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHHomeless_QuickPhase02_HomelessWoman_001="I really need to be alone. Just go away, please..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_001="Hey, how's it going?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_003="Having a bad day at the office?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_004="Worst. Interview. Ever."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_005="Actually, I wanted to ask if that's your bitchin' 1977 Needham eighteen-wheeler out there."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_008="Uh... oh yeah, that sucks..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_009="That sucks."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_012="Listen, Kate Marsh was not a slut. She was severely depressed for good reasons. You didn't even know her, did you?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_013="Maybe you should leave then."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_016="You knew Rachel Amber? Can you tell me about her?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_019="I took a Blackwell class on the history of... truckers. I always wanted to drive a rig on the road."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_020="My friend Rachel Amber told me about this cool rig in town because I love taking pictures of truckers."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Max_023="Oh, so you must have known her too?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_002="Peachy. Interview over."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_006="Some punks messed with the train tracks and now I have to wait for three days until I get my cargo. Time is money for a guy like me."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_007="Work has dried up around here and I have bills to pay. Time is money for a guy like me."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_010="Wish I could drive right out of goddamn Arcadia Bay. The whole town is crumbling—snow, eclipse, that slut suicide..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_011="Wish I could drive right out of Arcadia Bay. The whole town is crumbling—snow, eclipse, and a slut trying to commit suicide..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_014="I know all these Blackwell spoiled shits. Like that other loser I'd see around here... Rachel."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_015="Would if I could. Hell, even that shifty Rachel what's-her-face asked me once if I'd drive her to Los Angeles..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_017="Nope. Christ, why don't you get a real job instead of homework? I'd love to see you Blackwell turds try to drive my 1977 Needham eighteen-wheeler out there! Like I said, interview over."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_018="How the hell did you know that?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_021="Finally, a Blackwell student with brains. Next time I get a local job, I'll let you ride along. Take care."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_022="You knew Rachel? She sure didn't give a rat's ass about truckers... or real work."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Phase01_Trucker_024="Only from the diner. She was just a gold digger—she belonged in California with all those... you know whats... good riddance. But you can take pictures of my truck anytime. Take care."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_QuickPhase01_Trucker_001="Uh, do they teach English over at that arty farty school? I'm done talking. Over and out."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_QuickPhase02_Trucker_001="Let's talk about my photo shoot later. 10-4."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_CHTrucker_Trucker_010="Hey! No photo, girl!"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_FrankRV_Chloe_010="Oh, we could cruise everywhere in this bad boy. Can you see us heading down the coast to Big Sur and beyond?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_GarbageSearch_Chloe_010="What the hell is this? Gross..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_GarbageSearch_Chloe_020="More nasty shit..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_GarbageSearch_Chloe_030="Damn, there has to be food for you somewhere..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_Insertion_Chloe_010="Let's check the door. Frank gets so wasted he sometimes forgets to lock it."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_Insertion_Chloe_030="Not anymore."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_Insertion_Chloe_040="We have to be casual ninjas here..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_Insertion_Chloe_050="Shitballs. Okay, here's the plan. I'll go to the diner and distract Frank by telling him I have his money, but he needs to come with me. Then you come in and rewind so Frank doesn't see me, then you can tell Frank he needs to check out his RV and then you rewind after you get the key, and... uh... and..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_Insertion_Chloe_070="Don't let my epic plan get in the way of yours. I'll try to scrounge up a Scooby snack to distract his mangy mutt..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_Insertion_Max_020="I can't believe you hung out with him."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_Insertion_Max_060="Chloe, I got this. I'll be right back."

Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_OpenDoor_Chloe_050="...throw!"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_OpenDoor_Max_020="I couldn't have done it without Frank. Now let's get in and out."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_ThrowMeatFence_Chloe_020="I think we just made that dog our bitch... get it?"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_ThrowMeatFence_Max_010="Get the treat treat, boy!"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_ThrowMeatFence_Max_030="Now I can snoop in peace. But let's not waste time."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_ThrowMeatStreet_Chloe_020="The meat is in the street..."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_ThrowMeatStreet_Chloe_050="I bet he's fine—I'm sure he is... Come on, we definitely don't have time to waste now."
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_ThrowMeatStreet_Max_010="Get the treat treat, boy!"
Cue_E3_6B_DinerPark_ThrowMeatStreet_Max_040="Oh no. Please, please do not let that poor dog be hit..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_001="How are you doing, Maxine? I'm so sorry you had to be up with there with Kate when she... you know. Just know that we're proud of you for going up there."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_002="There she is, Super Maxine. That's your new nickname around the Bay. Sorry, but you did earn it. We're all real proud of you for helping Kate down."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_005="I'm glad you're representing Blackwell Academy."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_006="Don't make me backwash this bacon. You know what the Prescotts represent..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_007="You're not far wrong, Max. I heard the Prescotts are working on some new big land deals..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_008="Mr. Prescott helped out my family once, a while ago. So I made a deal with him... That I can't seem to get out of. Man, if I could get one instant replay in life...I better finish my breakfast first."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_012="Sometimes. I think they're more interested in new big land deals..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_014="I'd take a normal city with normal problems about now... Makes me sick thinking about it...."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_016="Not for long. He's a loose cannon. We all respect him for his service but he's too eager."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_019="That's true. He was ranting about a stolen gun then I tuned out... Somebody's always out to get him."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_021="Such a waste... awful..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_022="And you for helping her. That's the kind of school spirit we need more of."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_024="Bowers ain't no student anymore. Sadly, he does represent one side of Arcadia Bay... I want you to stay out of his orbit, okay? Him and that rabid mutt..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_026="Especially when the dog is your personal drooling bodyguard. You can bet he trained that poor thing on blood..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_028="Frank used to bet on dog fights. To his credit, he had a revelation and he saved a bunch of the dogs. Kept one for himself. He's still a creep. You and that Chloe stay away, right?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_030="Jesus, doesn't this town ever shut up?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Cop_032="Look, sometimes I check up on the Prescott family to make sure they're doing all right... Nathan included... Keep this quiet, Max."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_003="Thanks, Officer Berry. I know you guys deal with this stuff way more than me, but it is hard to deal with."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_004="Thanks, Officer Berry. I was just lucky... and right on time. Kate is who counts."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_009="I thought that Nathan Prescott represents Blackwell."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_010="Taking over Arcadia Bay?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_011="Protecting Nathan?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_013="Do you think Arcadia Bay is a weird town?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_015="I feel like David Madsen represents Blackwell."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_017="He's eager to be a dick to me and Chloe."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_018="He seems eager to help find Rachel..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_020="I guess Kate Marsh will be the face of Blackwell for a while..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_023="Nathan said that Rachel Amber represents Blackwell... with Frank Bowers."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_025="I heard something about Frank Bowers and his puppy. A boy does love his dog..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_027="Gross. I wouldn't bet. Where did he get the pup?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_029="Well, I heard a rumor you were working for the Prescott family on the side."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_Puzzle_Max_031="I don't blame you for getting extra work."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_QPhase01_Cop_001="We'll chat later, Max."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHCop_QPhase02_Cop_001="What can I do for you, Max?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_001="What. The. Fuck... Why are you wearing Rachel's clothes? Huh?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_006="I'm trembling. I don't need to take his little museum piece."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_007="Because she looks beautiful in them and you look like ass. Aiming a gun doesn't make you any sexier."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_008="Because she looks beautiful in them and you look like ass. You're lucky I just took that gun from you..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_010="Let's not. You fucking creep me out."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_016="Aren't you supposed to be a smart student?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_019="Thanks, Godmother. But I don't need your favors. And Chloe doesn't get any from me."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_020="Well, nice fucking try. Chloe can pay her own bills."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_022="What do you know about it?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_024="So I gave Nathan some prescription meds... as a friend. Who isn't doped up at your age? Woopie-fucking-doo."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_026="Haha! Oh yeah, sure. Do you want "The Afterschool Special" to go with that? Jesus... Look, I don't sell anything but bottles to feed me and my dog. I work for a living, not like you spoiled Blackwell punks with too much time on your hands."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_028="But nothing. Don't ever ask me for anything ever again. Ever. Now back off."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_030="Uh... How d'you know about that, huh? Chloe, right?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_032="Really? Yeah, I mean that's what I thought. She was just a natural beauty, y'know. Wait—wait let me... lemme find it... here, judge for yourself."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_035="One, I'm not acting. Two, who told you about the dogs?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_039="Not as much as me. How can I trust a shitty liar with my dog?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_040="I won't even let you pick up the dog shit."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Frank_041="Besides, you don't want a leash—you want these keys right here. Look at your eyes dilate. You're worse than a junkie, Max. But no fix for you."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_002="How do you know these are Rachel's clothes?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_005="David Madsen is looking for that gun. He might show up on your RV step..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_009="Grab your keys and let's check out your RV..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_015="Could I get you to drop Chloe's debt?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_017="You'll find out if you do me this favor..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_018="Not all the time. But I have to try everything..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_021="I bet you and Nathan could go shoot bottles together like besties... doped up on meds."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_023="Personal experience. Plus I'm in high school. Teens talk."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_025="By the way Frank... I was wondering if you had any... uh... "Higher Education.""
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_027="But..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_029="You know, I saw that photo Rachel gave you."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_031="She just told me that one of Rachel's favorite pictures was the one she did for you."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_033="You act so scary, but... you did save all those dogs..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_036="It's actually a great story. You're an animal lover."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_037="I love dogs. I'm a pretty good walker if you need somebody... I can go get him from your RV right now. Love dogs."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_Puzzle_Max_038="Could I pet the doggie? I could go grab him from your RV right now... "
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_QPhase01_Frank_001="Get a new outfit and leave me alone."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHFrank_QPhase02_Frank_001="What the fuck now?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_002="Considering we're in a public diner with a police officer right over there, you shouldn't advertise your rage... Prescott."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_004="Your sugar daddy will always protect you—and threaten me."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_006="You're his bitch, right?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_007="Then tell me what I should know."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_010="I can afford it. You can't. So maybe we can make a deal..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_011="Maybe I could help you."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_019="If I wanted to I could have mentioned Frank gave you prescription meds for your personal use..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_021="Because I know things."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_023="I bet Frank hooked you and Rachel Amber up with party supplies..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_025="I doubt that."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_026="Says who? Frank?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_029="Listen Nathan, I'll take back everything I said about you—if you hook me up with Frank... know what I mean?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_031="How do you think I stay wired all night studying? So is it a deal or not?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_033="I bet you hoped that Kate Marsh would stay quiet..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_035="Did you rape her?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_036="Did you drug her?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_039="Calm down, dude. We're in the diner..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_043="I heard your dad hired a local cop to keep an eye out on you and Frank Bowers... like a babysitter."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_045="Does Frank know that? I bet his dad can't protect him."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_047="Do they? I hope that means Frank won't get busted..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_049="How can I forget a "blood oath"?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_051="Don't say another word about her. Or you will regret it. Seriously."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_053="Weren't you supposed to keep your mouth shut about the blood oath Frank took for Rachel?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Max_055="Yet Rachel Amber hung out with him more than you."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_001="You are shitting me... Where did you get those clothes? You don't even know Rachel... What are you up to? Huh? Tell me stat, Caulfield!"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_003="Oh yeah? You shouldn't have bitch-snitched on me to that fucked up principal."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_005="You don't know shit about my father, or me. Nobody here does!"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_008="Oh Max, you are going to pay for that one."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_009="Why? So you can pretend to care, hm? Spoiler alert, he's an asshole."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_012="I don't need you for anything except to stay out of my fucking business, understand? Now get out of my face!"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_020="How—how did you know that?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_022="No worries. 'Cause you're the one trying to fake it till you make it. At least you were smart enough to keep your big mouth shut in the Principal's office..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_024="Nice try. Rachel partied like a fiend on her own. More than me."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_027="Like you would know, virgin. Even that pig over there knows Rachel hung out more with Frank... I mean, don't talk to the cop about that, dumbass."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_028="Everybody knows. Even that pig over there. Anyway. Get the fuck out of my face."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_030="You look like you've never even taken a hit of baby aspirin."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_032="Calm down, hard up. Deal. You'll get your school supplies. Just go over to Frank and whisper, "Higher Education." He'll hook your ass up..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_034="Idiot says what?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_037="You are fucking evil, Max. No way are you asking me this... I didn't touch her and I wouldn't! You just crossed my red line, you little—"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_038="You're so stupid, Max. You think you're so goddamn smart too! Don't push me, girl. You don't want me for an enemy, understand? Do you?"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_040="Right... plus you're an adult now. I can sue your dumb ass for libel. Thanks. Now fuck off, dyke!"
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_044="Bullshit. My dad doesn't hire, he owns. And these pigs know better than to narc on me."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_046="Too bad, so fucking sad. Guy's into freaky shit. Man, he told me he once took a weird blood oath for Rachel... Uh, forget I told you that. Seriously."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_048="Eventually he will. Guy is into some freaky shit. He told me he once took a weird blood oath for Rachel... Uh, forget I told you that. Seriously."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_050="If you say anything to Frank, I will fuck your shit up hard. You and that slut, Chloe."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_052="Now get off my crack, whore. Keep your piehole shut."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_054="Blood oath? Who—? What the fuck? I never told anybody about that freaky shit... Besides, everybody knows Frank is a liar and a loser. Even Rachel did..."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_Puzzle_Nathan_056="So? Rachel wanted Frank's stash. She let him take pictures... Then he carries around her photo like she posed for love. Dumbass."
Cue_E3_6B_Diner_CHNathan_QPhase01_Nathan_001="Are you fucking stupid? Get out of my space!"

﻿[Diary]
Chara_FrankBowers_A="I'll never forget Frank—if only because he's the first and last person I will ever aim a gun at. How did Chloe end up in this sketchy drug dealer's orbit? The weird thing is that when I first saw him threatening Chloe in the junkyard, I was more shocked how un-creepy he looked. I expected some try-hard gangster, but he looked more like a dumpster diving troll. Which I guess he kinda is since we were on his turf, testing out my rewind skills for Chloe's amusement."
Chara_Franks_A="I'll never forget Frank—if only because he's the first and last person I will ever aim a gun at. How did Chloe end up in this sketchy drug dealer's orbit?

I expected some try-hard gangster, but he looked more like a dumpster diving troll. Which I guess he kinda is since we were on his turf, testing out my rewind skills for Chloe's amusement."
Chara_Joyce_A="Talking to Joyce Price after five years was almost as intense as seeing Chloe again. Especially right back in "ye olde" Two Whales Diner. That clinking of silverware and the smell of sizzling bacon rewound me back to being a kid, hanging out there with my parents for breakfast. I remember her always smiling at Chloe, even in mischief. Doubt she smiles at her hijinks now, but they still banter like mother and daughter."
Chara_Joyce_B="I moved to Seattle so soon after William died that I never saw how it affected Joyce. I'm glad she's not pissed at me for being selfish and never looking back. I still remember the last time Chloe and I saw him alive. I wonder how often Joyce relives that day? That's the worst kind of rewind: one you can't control. But if I could go back to that moment... what would I do?"
Chara_Joyce_C="I can only imagine how Joyce ended up with David Madsen. Talk about opposites. You can tell she loves him—disturbing as that sounds. Maybe she just wanted a more structured life for herself... Obviously it didn't work out that way with Chloe. I hope they both treat her right. Joyce deserves the best."
E3_Page00_A="October 9"
E3_Page00_B=""Dear Diary... I have the power to rewind time and I ended up on a rooftop trying to stop my friend from jumping off while trying to prevent the possible destruction of my hometown..." I fell asleep at my desk and woke up reaching out to rewind... or grab Kate..."
E3_Page00_C="I remember when my journal entries were about which anime character I wanted to be. Or my dreams of being a respected globe-hopping photographer. Or what me and Chloe would be doing when we were finally adults... at least we know how that turned out so far."
E3_Page00_D="Chloe is determined to get to the bottom of what's going on. So I've been playing "What Would Chloe Do?"—which means blowing off my Blackwell homework to research everything I can find on Kate Marsh, Rachel Amber, and the esteemed Prescotts. It would be too easy peasy if they were all connected but at this point,"
E3_Page01_A="I think the whole town of Arcadia Bay is connected to this crazy shit. I can already see the story on the National Geographic Channel: "Mystic, Scientific, or Apocalyptic? The Arcadia Bay Tornado.""
E3_Page01_B="Shudder."
E3_Page01_C-katealive="Speaking of fear, I still think about Kate and the sadness in her eyes on that roof. I'm so grateful she's alive. I love seeing the students at Blackwell show their support for her with gifts and flowers. Finally. "
E3_Page01_C-katedead="Speaking of fear, I can still see Kate and her sad, hopeless eyes on that roof... I can't believe she's not here anymore... I heard some students are organizing a petition for Blackwell to set up a scholarship in her memory. That's the least this place could do for her..."
E3_Page01_D-davidS="I almost felt bad when I didn't see David on campus harassing students. But he brought this on himself. I don't know what he's up to or how he's involved, but there's no way he's just playing private detective. Then I think about Joyce—how I've just helped her new husband lose his job. It has to make him treat Chloe better, right?"
E3_Page01_D-jeffS="So that's cool that I got Mr. Jefferson in trouble and he won't be representing Blackwell at the "Everyday Heroes" contest. I don't blame him for what happened to Kate... Yes, he should have listened to her. But it's not fair he can't attend the event. Now the winner has to hang out with Principal Wells—I hope Victoria wins. But one of my heroes probably hates me. Yay Max."
E3_Page01_D-maxS="Even though it's total bullshit that I got suspended, I'm actually happy to have the time—no pun intended this time. Okay, puns intended. Stop me. But I can at least plan the next steps with Chloe in our investigation. I'm so glad she's here to help me with this. Though she needs to step outside herself a little bit more and see what's going on here. It's not all about her."
E3_Page01_D-nathanS="At least I feel better now that Nathan is suspended. It's good he's off campus for a few days... I hope. And like I give a shit if the Prescott family sends a team of lawyers after me. Please. I doubt they would like all the publicity. I doubt their tentacles reach into the rest of Oregon... not yet, anyway."
E3_Page01_D-noS="My homework is seriously piling up. It's hard to focus on tests or essays while my friends suffer, nature shits, and we track down Rachel Amber. Along with my ability to rewind time and visions of an apocalyptic storm, how can I think about giving Mr. Jefferson a photo for the contest with all this shit going on? But I should, if only to keep myself grounded..."
E3_Page02_A="Leave it to Chloe to make me sneak out past curfew and demand I meet her in front of the main building in the dead of night. I knew Chloe would be all over investigating the campus after what happened to Kate here... This just makes Chloe more desperate to find out what happened to Rachel... if anything. "
E3_Page02_B="It's funny that even though I think I can just rewind myself out of trouble, I'm in more trouble now than ever before in my life. If this was a Twilight Zone story I'd be getting set up for some serious irony. Like I'm going to rewind myself out of existence or something..."
E3_Page02_C="Can I honestly say I'll have this ability for the rest of my life? Are the tornado, the snow, and that eclipse just hallucinations or are they genuine prophecy? More importantly, is this a curse or blessing? Chloe is alive and by my side and that has to be a miracle... which means there must be a way to stop my vision from coming true... Right?"
E3_Page02_D="So, yes, I broke curfew to hook up with Chloe. She said she had something to show me... Looks like it's time for some serious detective work."
E3_Page02_E="Enter The Blackwell Ninjas!"
E3_Page02_F-katealive="As I stealthily made my way out of the hall, I passed by Kate's door and saw all the nice messages from other students. Too bad most of Blackwell didn't care when they passed around the video and bullied her to that roof. Everybody always cares when it's too late... At least Kate will see that people are on her side... finally. I hope I can visit her when all this blows over... Maybe that's not a good choice of words."
E3_Page02_F-katedead="As I stealthily made my way out of the hall, I saw a shrine in front of Kate's door. I was surprised when it just popped up right after she died. Like everybody at Blackwell suddenly felt guilty for how she was treated. I am glad that so many people wanted to honor her. The cynical side of me says, "Too little, way too fucking late." But I know that Kate would smile and forgive us all. Sigh. Cry."
E3_Page03_A="Day-um, that was too close. I was doing so well until I got outside and of course, it was Principal Wells of all people blocking the way. The one person I least wanted to see. I wasn't ninja enough for him so yeah, he busted me. But, I finally got to see that the gossip was true for a change."
E3_Page03_B="Principal Wells was shitfaced. He didn't even try to hide it. In fact, he was a lot cooler drunk than sober. I can see why he's so confused, dealing with Kate's family, and the Prescotts, and David Madsen. He still acts suspicious and gives me way too much "'tude" as he would say (nobody says that seriously!), but I can see that he's under a lot of pressure. So much that he's so wasted he can't even use his keys at midnight. "
E3_Page03_C="Sure he was in my way, but he was no match for my rewind power. After all, I had to go and meet Chloe... Bad Max."
E3_Page03_D="Even though I thought I was in "full ninja mode," Chloe still scared the shit out of me, which pissed me off considering what I've been going through. Sometimes she's so damn insensitive to other people's feelings."
E3_Page03_F="She wants all my attention for her and finding Rachel and she gets all butthurt if I don't have time for her. Obviously I have time in hand. But I can't stay mad at her for long and she was so damn excited about having the keys to the main building. And honestly? I was pretty amped up too."
E3_Page04_A="Even more so when we went to the front of the building and spied on Victoria talking smack about me (shocked!) and worse, actually trying to blackmail Mr. Jefferson to pick her photo for the "Everyday Heroes" contest. She is freaking unreal..."
E3_Page04_B="I give Mr. Jefferson major respect for telling her to get lost, even though she deserved to be expelled for pulling that crap. This is her priority after what happened with Kate? I just don't understand Victoria, no matter how I try. She's already rich, pretty, and a good photographer. Why try so hard and hurt so many to manipulate everything already in your favor? "
E3_Page04_C="I just hope that's not what I'm doing with my rewind power..."
E3_Page04_D="Yes, there's something incredibly AWESOME about breaking into your own school at the witching hour. Although Chloe was technically right: how can we break in with a key? Never mind that it was a stolen key from the school's head of security... "
E3_Page04_E="Anyway. The Blackwell Ninjas strike again!"
E3_Page05_A="So cool to stalk the halls when it's dark and quiet. Even with so many terrible things happening all around us, it felt like Chloe and I were walking towards the center of a great cosmic mystery, something bigger than any of us..."
E3_Page05_B="But we kinda suck as master spies since we didn't have a key for the Principal's office. No worries with my rewind power at hand. And of course Doctor Warren Graham. He came through with a bitchin' mini-bomb made of sodium whatthefuckever. I probably learned more putting those ingredients together than the entire semester so far. Sorry, Ms. Grant, Warren is the star student here. He tries so hard to help... maybe too much, but what's wrong with that these days? I'm so grateful he's on my team."
E3_Page05_C="Talk about being in the sancto sanctorum (thanks Latin class I barely passed!) of Blackwell... I did feel freaking weird about being in the Principal's office after midnight, going through his files and laptop with Chloe. She was waaaay too into it. Technically, we could be arrested and thrown in jail. Yikes. I just pretended that we were on a very special episode of "The Wizards of Waverly Place," you know, just a couple of "wacky Sherlocks" investigating the school for a good cause... Yeah, that helped."
E3_Page06_A="While we didn't find The Proof, we found Nathan's file had a weird drawing in it that just said, "Rachel in the dark room" over and over. So that's a major clue that Nathan is involved in this somehow. Or he's just insane. But his note also referenced "David M." which means that we absolutely have to find a way into David's secret bunker files. For a good cause."
E3_Page06_B-nomoney="But Chloe just can't help herself and she actually wanted to take five grand in cash marked "handicapped fund" ('cause that's gotta be legit, amirite?)—I can't think of a faster route to karma hell, but it would have paid off Chloe's debt to Frank... I stopped her, but it kind of bothers me that Chloe can be so selfish like that. I'm not going to let anything happen to her, but I can't just let her do anything she wants... "Mad Max"? More like Mommy Max..."
E3_Page06_B-takemoney="But Chloe just can't help herself and she actually took five grand in cash marked "handicapped fund" ('cause that's gotta be legit, amirite?)—I can't think of a faster route to karma hell, but it would clear Chloe's debt to Frank... I'll find a way to make it up to the fund... after all, saving a life is priority. As is my habit with Chloe. No matter what, our fates seem bound together, for better or worse. \n\nUsually worse."
E3_Page06_C="Despite all the "usual" breaking in and blowing up office hijinks, Chloe decided what we needed more than anything was to take a night swim in the Otter's lair. I was so giddy and rebellious that I was like, oh yes, WE SHALL SWIM. We didn't completely skinny-dip but close enough to get in big trouble no matter what. I don't know why we were so careless after being so careful..."
E3_Page07_A="I love that Chloe brings out the "just don't give a fuck" side of me. Even if that hasn't always served her well. She deserved a moment of not giving a shit. Me too. Just two friends goofing around in the pool. I fear those youthful shenanigans might soon be a thing of our past... God, I'm starting to sound like one of the teachers at Blackwell..."
E3_Page07_B="Chloe and I had a nice chat about our lives since I left... We talked about dumb boys and girls and why they're trouble... especially for me. I feel like a groupie when I talk to Chloe about our life experience... she has me so beat. I take pictures, she takes action."
E3_Page07_C="Speaking of action, we had to seriously bounce when security showed up. Duh. How quiet could we be in the swimming pool? Plus after leaving a trail of our Blackwell handiwork..."
E3_Page07_D="It was so intense and exciting to get past the security guards. They had serious spotlight power so it wasn't exactly easy to stealth our way past, especially as we had to bail in Chloe's junker... but like I said, intense and exciting. Hella like Chloe Price."
E3_Page08_A="Even though my body smelled like I had been doused in chlorine, it was so nice to crash in Chloe's room for the first time in five years and wake up next to her like our old sleepovers... For some reason, it reminded me of the time we were going to TP one of the neighbor's houses and we even snuck out but got chicken and ran back home, laughing all the way..."
E3_Page08_B="I remember waking up the next day and Joyce was making one of her delish breakfasts downstairs and Chloe smiled at me like we were in the most secret club in the world (or at least Arcadia Bay) we were pirates, damn it! After our academic espionage last night, I felt the same way... it's just that now the stakes are much higher and much more dangerous."
E3_Page08_C="I even ended up in some of Rachel Amber's clothes since mine were trashed. A band tee and ripped jeans. So not me. But I haven't found my style yet, so why not have some fun experimenting with a new outfit? Speaking of experiments, Chloe dared me to kiss her..."
E3_Page08_D-kiss="So I did. She probably thought I'd wuss out. Why? It wasn't that big a deal. Though it was cute the way she was kind of embarrassed after and said she would tell Warren. "
E3_Page08_D-nokiss="I would have, but I didn't like being dared like it was some big deal. Maybe I am scared. Of what? I think I'm too young for marriage. And Chloe and I might kill each other. "
E3_Page08_E="Besides, I think Chloe sees Rachel Amber in her future..."
E3_Page09_A="When I went down to breakfast, Joyce actually called me "Rachel" which just seems so wrong considering how beautiful she is and how boring I am. I guess my new outfit really is working its magic. I ended up helping Joyce make breakfast just like when I was a kid on a sleepover. It's odd how quickly you can fall back into an old routine."
E3_Page09_B="So I must have set off Joyce's "nostalgia mode" since she busted out ye olde photo album. I'm one of the few people who loves checking out old pictures. What was that Alfred Hitchcock line about film being "pieces of time"? Like Mr. Jefferson said, so are photographs."
E3_Page09_C="I do think she wanted me to see her new husband in a better light. When David was happy or laughing with Joyce in a picture, I wanted to say, "And who is that?" Plus, I'm sure it's no accident that there was a photo of Rachel wearing the exact same clothes I had on. She truly is stunning. And somehow looked more punk rock than Chloe. "
E3_Page09_D="The truly heartbreaking image was the last photo William Price ever took: Chloe and I making pancakes in the kitchen. Joyce really misses that joyful optimistic girl... I know she's still there... when Chloe smiled at me this morning, I saw her. The picture seemed to sum up everything we had as children and lost as adults... whatever being an "adult" means. "
E3_Page10_A="So today I finally found out what was in David's secret files... and I admit, I expected it to be worse. I'm relieved that it wasn't, so maybe I'm going easier on him than I should. No surprise that he had detailed files on Kate AND Rachel listing their whereabouts along with surveillance pics. David isn't off my shit-list yet, but he's a damn good investigator, I'll give him that. It's clear that Frank and Rachel had some kind of relationship... and I don't think Chloe is going to be very happy to hear that. She needs to start waking up. We all do."
E3_Page10_B="When David came home, things escalated quickly. He had been fired, but shrugged when he saw me wearing Rachel's clothes. He was so on edge... Maybe I'll never get to see the David that Joyce loves so much. She and Chloe really let him have it, though. This was the first time I saw them bond since we were kids..."
E3_Page10_C="Which was a perfect cue for Chloe to bounce into the room and start shit with Joyce. This gave me cruel cover so I could sneak into the garage and finally unlock David Madsen's X-treme Files..."
E3_Page10_C-defendD="But my spidey sense told me that David needed somebody to defend him. Even just this once. I just don't feel that we have enough proof to really blame him for everything. Yes, he's a harassing bully with a surveillance fetish, but he seems to be gathering information for his own investigation. The mystery story side of me appreciates that and hopes we can use his research to buffer our own..."
E3_Page10_C-denounceD="Suddenly, I couldn't take it anymore either and I kind of blew up. It was like a torrent that felt AWESOME. I've been wanting to rip into David like that myself for a long time. I figured worst case scenario, hello rewind power! But I wanted Joyce to know the depth of his weird paranoia. She looked so sad and angry when I told her about the photos of Rachel and Kate, not to mention the home surveillance. Joyce kicked his ass out of the house. To Chloe's glee."
E3_Page10_D="When David came home, things escalated quickly. He looked more upset than usual, but shrugged when he saw me wearing Rachel's clothes. He was so on edge... Maybe I'll never get to see the David that Joyce loves so much. She and Chloe really let him have it, though. This was the first time I saw them bond since we were kids..."
E3_Page11_A="Despite David's evidence and the bracelet, Chloe refused to believe Rachel was involved with Frank. This is a part of Chloe I don't much like: she gets so damn petulant if she doesn't get her way. Or if she hears something she doesn't like. Serious denial. I get why, but that doesn't make dealing with it any easier. So I threw my hands up and suggested we check out Frank's RV. "
E3_Page11_B="I knew that would piss Chloe off and she would do anything to find out what kind of relationship he had with Rachel."
E3_Page11_C="But first we had to get the damn keys to the RV. Which meant going into the Two Whales Diner and bouncing like a rewind pinball between Frank, Nathan Prescott, and Officer Berry—and fucking with all of them. I'm still dizzy thinking about how I pulled it off. Yay for Max."
E3_Page11_D="Sometimes I feel like I'm just cheating at life..."
E3_Page12_A-feeddog="The first thing we had to do was get Frank's scary dog out of the RV. So, we did the classic cartoon "give a dog a bone" routine and Cujo became Scooby Doo just like that."
E3_Page12_A-hurtdog="Oh my God! I don't want to think I hurt the poor thing but when I threw the meat bone out for Frank's scary dog, he ran out into the street... and I heard a screech of brakes and a loud whimper."
E3_Page12_B="Frank's RV was pretty much what I expected—drug dealer trash chic. But it wasn't as serial killer as I feared. We ransacked the place and found what Chloe didn't want us to find..."
E3_Page12_C="I'm sorry Chloe had to see the pictures of Rachel posing for Frank, even if she did care about him. To her it's just another betrayal, just another loved one dumping on her. Everybody she ever loved she lost one way or another. Only I came back from the past... for what? To make Chloe's life more painful? I just wish I could use my rewind power to go all the way back to the days when we were covered in pancake flour... Life was simple..."
E3_Page12_D-givegun="I found Chloe's gun (or should I say David's gun?) and reluctantly gave it back to her. I honestly don't feel that she's any safer with it, especially considering how stupid she acts with it. But I definitely don't want Frank coming after Chloe with her own weapon. "
E3_Page12_D-leavegun="I found Chloe's gun (or should I say David's gun?) and decided not to give it back to her. I honestly don't feel that she's any safer with it, especially considering how stupid she acts with it. But I don't want Frank coming after Chloe... I just have to make sure he doesn't."

She has caused numerous class disruptions with inappropriate comments and rude gestures to fellow students. \nShe was recently suspended for spray-painting graffiti in the parking lot.\n\nEven though Chloe is an intelligent student with potential, she chooses to squander it on empty rebellion against a non-mandatory institution.\n\nUPDATE: \nChloe Price is no longer a student at Blackwell.\nSee Attached Police Reports"
E3_2A_PrinOffice_Computer_SP01="Dear Mr. & Mrs. Prescott,\nWe regret to inform you that Nathan Prescott has disrupted various classes over the past month despite repeated warnings and leniency. Due to a crude outburst in Mrs. Hoida's Intro To Literature class on Tuesday, September 17, Nathan was sent back to his dormitory for the day – without a proper write-up for his files. Nathan has enormous potential but also erratic behavior patterns that may need supervision beyond Blackwell's ability. The school cannot tolerate these disruptions so we hope you will discuss this matter with Nathan to impress upon him the severity of this situation.\n\nPlease see the attached files for the full reports. \n\nUPDATE: EXPUNGED RECORD\n\n\nDear Principal Wells\n\nWe received a rather outrageous and possibly slanderous letter from somebody in Administration accusing Nathan of uncharacteristic "erratic behavior patterns."

Cue_E4_2B_Garage_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_012="Which is stupid because you are so damn cool. Some bro has to be crushing on you."

Cue_E4_2B_Garage_ChloeBed_IGE_Chloe_070="Max, thanks for being a real friend."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_ChloeBed_IGE_Max_015="That’s why they call it a “sleepover.”"

Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GiveMedicine_Chloe_050="Oh, trust me, I will."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GiveMedicine_Chloe_060="Of course, my pain just keeps getting worse... but you caught me on a good day. Max, I'm so grateful that I'm even able to hang out with you. See, I'm getting mushy. I'm already high."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GiveMedicine_Chloe_080="Um, stop me if I'm being too emo, but can you grab one of the photo albums over there? I'd like to check out some old pictures of us when we were kids."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GiveMedicine_Max_020="I'm sorry. I'm nosy, but not precise."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GiveMedicine_Max_040="Um, okay, but get ready to yell for your folks if I screw up."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GiveMedicine_Max_070="You are so adorable. Do you want anything else?"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GiveMedicine_Max_090="Please. My diary is like emo ground zero. Plus Max Caulfield does not pass up a photo op with Chloe Price. Ever."

Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Chloe_025="Oh my God, look how little we are there! We look like toys!"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Chloe_040="My dad was pissed at us. He actually tried to give us a time-out!"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Chloe_060="Whoa, awesome picture. We look so badass in our pirate gear."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Chloe_080="There’s still time for you..."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Chloe_085="Oh man, there we are making pancakes. I love that shot of us. It's hard to believe my dad took that picture only five years ago."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Chloe_100="I wish it was."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Chloe_120="Listen, Max, my respiratory system is failing and... and it's only getting worse.|I've heard the doctors talking about it when they thought I was zonked out.|So I know I'm just putting off the inevitable,|while my parents suffer along... and I will, too.|This isn't how I want things to end."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Chloe_140="I'm saying that being with you again has been so special. I just wanted to feel like when we were kids running around Arcadia Bay... and everything was possible.|And you made me feel that way today. I want this time with you to be my last memory...|Do you understand?"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Max_010="Is that okay?"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Max_030="I remember that day by the lighthouse."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Max_050="And you laughed at him. My dad would have banished me."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Max_070="We should have taken over Arcadia Bay when we had the chance."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Max_090="Literally seems like yesterday…"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Max_110="Me too…"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Max_130="What? What are you saying?"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_GivePhotoAlbum_Max_150="Yes, I do."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Accept_Chloe_010="All you have to do is crank up the IV to eleven..."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Accept_Chloe_030="I’ll just drift asleep... dreaming of us here together... forever."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Accept_Chloe_040="Thank you so much.|I'm so proud of you for following your dreams.|Don't forget about me."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Accept_Chloe_060="I love you, Max.|See you around."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Accept_Max_020="Chloe…"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Accept_Max_050="Never."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Accept_Max_070="Sooner than you think…"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Dontknow_Chloe_020="Max, you were there for your friend no matter what. Now I'm asking you to help me the same way."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Dontknow_Chloe_040="At least you have a choice. When you want to make a decision, you can just do it. Look at me, I'm at the mercy of... everybody.| For once, I want to make my own choice... the most important one of my life. Please... help me, Max."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Dontknow_Max_010="Chloe... I really don't know if I can do this. I had another friend who wanted to... end it all and I did everything I could to try and save her life. How can I be responsible for ending yours? I mean, there's got to be another way."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Dontknow_Max_030="I want to help you, Chloe, but I think my help is hurting."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Refuse_Chloe_010="All you have to do is crank up the IV to eleven..."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Refuse_Chloe_030="I’m an adult. I’m giving you the right."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Refuse_Chloe_050="I already said my goodbyes to them, but they won't honor my wishes. You will... right?"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Refuse_Chloe_070="Max, I’m dying from my illness, not my dosage. This accelerates the process. I’d rather go out on a wave than a rock. And I want my best friend to help me out…"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Refuse_Chloe_090="Why, Max? You're just bailing on me like everybody else! Why don't you go now? You've been wanting to since you got here, right? So go and don't come back."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Refuse_Max_020="Chloe... I can't. It wrecks me to see you in any pain, but I don't have any right to do this."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Refuse_Max_040="But Joyce... and William…"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Refuse_Max_060="I can't... kill you with an overdose."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Refuse_Max_080="I am going to help you, but not like that. You have to believe me, Chloe."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Refuse_Max_100="Chloe, I am never leaving you again."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_MedicineChoice_Refuse_Max_110="I’m sorry, William…"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_PolaRewind_Chloe_010="Not until I see it first! You know the rules, Dad!"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_PolaRewind_Chloe_020="You mean pancakes?"

Come on, now say "Pancake!"

Cue_E4_2B_Garage_TurnPage_Max_010="This photo… Maybe I could…"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_WakeUp_Chloe_020="I know you were beat down after the day with me. And Blade Runner is a pretty dreamy movie to watch at night. Uh, do you think Deckard is a replicant?"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_WakeUp_Chloe_030="Sorry, I can see you’re not wide awake like me."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_WakeUp_Chloe_050="I do have a mother and father when you’re not falling asleep on me."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_WakeUp_Chloe_070="It’s the company I keep…"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_WakeUp_Chloe_080="Yesterday was such a blast."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_WakeUp_Chloe_100="I know things were different when we were just dorky kids, but being with you made me feel like when we were little pirates, jumping and running through the forests again. It meant a lot to me just to chill out with you and bullshit."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_WakeUp_Chloe_110="Ahh... Fuck. Um, I'm getting my regular head pains... Uh, can you pretty please go upstairs and get my—my morphine injector in the bathroom?"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_WakeUp_Chloe_130="It's—ahh. It's total Star Trek shit. You can't even see the needle. Seriously, I need it. Um, my parents keep the swag upstairs because they think I can't get to it... but you can, Max. Like a pirate, right?"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_WakeUp_Max_010="I cannot believe you fell asleep so fast. How dare you."
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_WakeUp_Max_040="No, I’m sorry I crashed so hard. Were you... okay?"
Cue_E4_2B_Garage_WakeUp_Max_060="You are a bitch in the morning."

Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_008="Hello again, William."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_009="I know it must be hard on you guys, financially."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_010="I don't know how to say this, but I am truly sorry about what happened to Chloe."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_013="I was impressed by Chloe's room and all the high-tech equipment."

Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_018="William, I just want you to know that whatever happens,|I'll always be here for Chloe. Always."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_019="Is she mad at me for not staying in touch?|She should be, I have no excuse."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_020="She is amazing. I'm so glad you're here to help her... and be her father."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_023="I have to go see if Chloe needs anything. It was so great talking with you again."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_024="Being around you and Joyce again is so nostalgic."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_025="I was reading about that missing girl... Rachel Amber?"
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_026="What do you think is going on with all of this crazy weather and animals dying?"
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_027="The Prescott family might be bad news. What do you think about them?"
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_028="I should get back to Chloe..."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_029="So you finally made it to Paris?"
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_030="I can see her loving it there. You guys rock for going on a family adventure like that."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_Max_037="Sounds like you know them well. "
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_001="Why, yes, Max, I love going through bills. Kidding.|How can you bother me? I haven't seen you in forever."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_003="Nice to see you back."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_005="Good, or I'd be ascared if I didn't look like me... Of course, you seem more adult now. So what's on your mind?"
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_006="I'm so glad Joyce is here to help us both. Max, I just hate to think of what would happen to Chloe if I wasn't here..."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_007="Me too. All it takes is a few minutes to change a girl's whole life. But she's alive. And she's been a trooper."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_011="These bills are more like crushing. We have to mortgage our home and that's pretty scary... but we'll get through it. The Price is always right. Get it? No?"
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_012="You should be. We could buy a few mansions for what it all costs. The insurance helps, but... I don't know, Max."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_014="She was disappointed, but she knows you care.|And I know how hard it is to process all this. It's taken us years."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_016="Very old school, as they say. I think it's great for Chloe to see you. It makes Joyce happy, too. So it's not all bad news in Arcadia Bay. Or is it?"
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_021="I know you will, Max. "
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_022="Oh yes, she went to Blackwell, right? Poor thing. That's a real nightmare for a family... I get scared thinking about Chloe and that we might... lose her someday."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_031="She talked about going to school there... but that's not practical anymore. It's not fair, Max..."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_032=""Oui," as they say. Not me, because I can't speak French. But it was a great experience, especially for Chloe."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_033="You act like it's the last time. And please, keep me from these bills whenever you want. "
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_034="Nobody knows, right? It is Nostradamus type shit, pardon my French. But all I actually care about now is Chloe and Joyce. My family."
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_035="Evil. Next question?"
Cue_E4_2B_LivingRoom_CHWilliam_Phase01_William_036="More than I want to. But Joyce has to work for those greedy bastards at Pan Estates. I don't even like to think about it."

Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Cloth_Max_040="So I’ve heard…"
Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Insertion_Chloe_020="Feels like a high-tech cell. But I am lucky my parents bust their ass to take care of me. I know it's hard for them..."
Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Insertion_Chloe_040="Right. Especially when they can’t even take a walk alone. Sometimes I act like a total teenage brat just to give them an excuse to yell at me. Pathetic, I know."
Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Insertion_Chloe_060="Trust me, I still get my rage on. Especially when a nurse has to watch while I take a dump, so she can wipe my bum. Or when doctors flip me around like I was a science doll..."
Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Insertion_Chloe_080="Thanks again for coming, Max. I, uh... need to get my drink on. Can you bring me some water?"
Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Insertion_Max_010="This is a pretty high-tech lair."

Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Movie_Chloe_010="See, I'm practically a human entertainment system. It would be sweet to chill out together and watch a movie, like when you'd spend the night at my house..."
Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Movie_Chloe_030="Uh, I think I'm in, like, a mellow "Blade Runner" mood. I always cry at the end. Plus you know I always wanted to have cool colored bangs like Pris."
Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Movie_Chloe_050="I remember, Max. Swear I won't fall asleep.|Not when you're here. Not yet."
Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Movie_Max_020="What do you want to watch?"
Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Movie_Max_040="I know. You would look incredible with blue hair.|Now let's get this show on the road.|And you better not fall asleep on me, like you always do when we watch movies."
Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Water_Chloe_020="Oh man, no wonder my throat is dry. I don’t think I’ve talked this much the whole year."
Cue_E4_2D_Garage_Water_Chloe_040="I wish I could punch your face right now. A podcast?|Dude, I am a pod in a cast. Boring."

Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_David_020="Anyway, I think we can both agree it's been a hard week on all of us... Especially poor Kate Marsh."

Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_David_028="That guy is an elitist prick. Now, I'm off-duty, so I can say it at home behind his back. Like when Chloe calls me "step-douche." These "artists" live in a fantasy world."

Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_David_032="These art-farts are all about themselves. When I was in the service, I hated the photographers who'd try to pose me in their anti-war bullshit."

Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_David_038="Although, you're like a walking surveillance system. I appreciate you standing up for me, but I have to be a hardass and tell you and Chloe to stay the hell out of this. Things are just gonna get more ugly."
Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_David_040="Now excuse me, Max, I have to get back to my camera. See, I'm an artist, too. "
Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_004="What do you mean by "dark places"?"
Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_005="Too late. I already know way too much. Like the fact that you might be working for Sean Prescott..."
Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_006="Too late. I already know way too much. So, do you and Nathan Prescott—"
Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_009="Yeah, I was lucky to only get suspended... thanks to you."
Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_010="I don't think luck had anything to do with it. I could have been suspended, too."

Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_017="No, David. But I know how powerful the Prescott family is... and you're working with them."
Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_021="Too bad nobody helped her when she needed it."

Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_029="Jefferson can be pretentious, but so can I... He's been a big influence on my photography."
Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_030="Why do you say that? "
Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_033="Well, Blackwell Academy is a school for artists, so maybe this isn't the best place for you."
Cue_E4_3B_Garage_CHDavid_Phase01_Max_039="Chloe and I can take care of ourselves. "

Cue_E4_3E_KateRoom_MeetKate_Kate_050="Now that you're here, I'm doing even better. I'm so grateful to you for coming up to the roof to talk me down... Max, I felt so lost and alone... but when I saw how much you cared, how hard you were trying... you made me realize I wasn't alone. Thank you."
Cue_E4_3E_KateRoom_MeetKate_Kate_070="I know, you should see all the letters and postcards. I gave most of the flowers to other patients here because they need them more than me. I'm keeping the balloons, though. One of the nurses gave me some pen and paper so I could do some drawings."
Cue_E4_3E_KateRoom_MeetKate_Kate_090="They got kind of dark there for a while, but I have an idea for a new children's book about bullying... I was thinking of having some photographs in there too."
Cue_E4_3E_KateRoom_MeetKate_Kate_110="Was that subtle? You better take the pictures, Max. I’m going to be here for another day until my family comes out to visit."
Cue_E4_3E_KateRoom_MeetKate_Kate_130="Like they need to protect me forever. They're so upset and I know they feel guilty, even though they didn't do anything. I was surprised how many students from Blackwell wrote me. Daniel, Mr. Jefferson... Even Victoria wrote me a very sweet note... and I believe she was being real."
Cue_E4_3E_KateRoom_MeetKate_Kate_150="I’m working on it, Max. I just pray I can get this drawing right…"
Cue_E4_3E_KateRoom_MeetKate_Max_020="Oh, Kate!"
Cue_E4_3E_KateRoom_MeetKate_Max_040="Kate, listen to me... you have nothing to be sorry about. Other people do. You do not know how happy I am to see you. You look awesome. Is it a stupid question if I ask how you're doing?"
Cue_E4_3E_KateRoom_MeetKate_Max_060="Kate, there are so many people who love you and want to help you."
Cue_E4_3E_KateRoom_MeetKate_Max_080="I love your illustrations."

Cue_E4_3E_KateRoom_MeetKate_Max_140="Me too. I’m glad you believe again, Kate."

Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Gun_Max_013="That was our old hideout. You shouldn't have hassled us there."

Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_003="Yeah, yeah... Everything is important these days. But I can tell you're not bullshitting me."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_006="Oh, is that all? Well, why didn't you just tell me? How about I just give you the keys to my RV while I'm at it?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_007="Uh, are you fucking mental? I lost my keys, but I changed the lock. You better goddamn not be snooping around here."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_008="Are you actually threatening me again, little girl?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_009="No, "man," I do not get it... especially from a weirdo like you.|You know, I hate the way you talk to me, like you... like you know more than I do."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_017="Yeah, yeah... well, it always starts with just a little. Chloe here knows all about that, don't you?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_018="Christ, I hate you Blackwell shits. You expect everything for free. You're not getting any handouts from me. I work for a living, you understand?"

Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_023="No, that shit would be over pretty fast. Don't fuck with me and I won't return the favor. So what do you want?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_024="After you pulled a fucking gun on me you want to negotiate my safety? I didn't trust you before and now I do less."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_025="By the way, never tell me what to do in my home. Maybe I don't have a fancy Arcadia Bay house, but this is my turf, got it? You're goddamn lucky you paid me back. So what do you want?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_026="Okay. There, you're safe. Now what do you want?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Frank_027="God, I hate you Blackwell shits. You act like you own this town... like I'm your puppet. Nobody owns me, you understand that?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Max_004="Frank, we're not here to get high. "
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Max_005="Just the names of some of your clients..."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Max_010="We wouldn't show up at your front door if it wasn't important. I mean, what kind of trick could I play on you? It's not about helping us... it's about helping you."

Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Max_019="Frank, uh... your dog is kind of scary, could you please close the RV door?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Max_020="Thanks for hearing me out, Frank. Look, we only want to talk and it's not even about you... We're not here to start a fight."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Negotiation_Max_021="Frank, um... after our last meeting, I don't want any weapons involved. Could you put your knife or... whatever in the RV until we're done talking?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Frank_001="Rachel? Is that why you're really here?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Frank_002="How the hell did you know about that photo? That's my favorite picture of her... I can look at it anytime and she'll always be there for me."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Frank_004="When Rachel vanished, I pretty much lost everything... "
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Frank_006="You and Chloe do not know Rachel like I did and I couldn't even help her. You're in way over your heads. Why don't you just go play in your clubhouse?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Frank_013="Don't you accuse me of anything. You don't know me or who I am. Or what I can do. You understand? Huh?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Frank_014="You read that letter? The one in my RV? Are you fucking insane? You read my private letter?!"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Frank_015="Never come into my home and tell me what to do, understand? "
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Frank_017="I can't stand not knowing where she is... not hearing her voice... or her laugh... anymore."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Frank_018="Man, there is something about you that is so wrong... I don't trust you at all. Now get out of my face."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Max_005="Yes, we're so close to finding her now, Frank. We need all the help we can get now... especially from you."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Max_007="We can change all that... it's up to you."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Max_008="Rachel said she gave you one of her favorite photos. That proves how much she cares... and you care. That's why you have to help."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Max_009="Frank, you knew Rachel almost better than anybody. And you know more than us. Together we could find her... Do you have anything to lose?"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Max_010="What are you hiding, Frank? You should want to help us, not scare us away."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Max_011="Listen, I read Rachel's letter... I know how much she cares about you. "
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Max_012="You have Rachel's bracelet. You obviously know more than you're telling. So tell us."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_CHFrank_Rachel_Max_019="We don't have much time, Frank. Rachel needs you."

Cue_E4_4A_Beach_Insertion_Chloe_030="Well, that asshole is going to help us find Rachel."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_Insertion_Chloe_050="Obviously I’m not counting on you. That’s why I have a gun. And I might even save you someday."

Cue_E4_4A_Beach_Insertion_Chloe_080="You know what would be great? If I still had a gun."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_Insertion_Chloe_100="Frank would scare better. He’s a pussy. Besides, if I take him out, you can just rewind…"
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_Insertion_Chloe_120="There's no way we could have guessed this is what would happen to us when we grew up."

Cue_E4_4A_Beach_Insertion_Max_150="Absolutely. So let’s play this cool, okay? Just pay Frank his money and then we can get that code for the book from him. That’s all."
Cue_E4_4A_Beach_Insertion_Max_151="Absolutely. So let’s play this cool, okay? Just talk to Frank so we can get that code for the book from him. That’s all."

Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Brooke_040="Acutally, he tried to chase down my drone earlier. It was so weird. Then he asked if I was going to the Vortex Club party... which I am. But I don't know..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Brooke_041="Warren's not good enough for you? Okay. I saw Nathan pissed and walking off campus earlier... Good luck getting that date, Max."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Brooke_042="Actually, he tried to chase down my drone earlier. It was so weird. Then he asked if I was going to the Vortex Club party... which I am. But I don't know..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Brooke_043="I did see him this morning heading off campus. He looked more angry than usual... I wouldn't look for him now, if I were you."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Brooke_044="Warren and I are supposed to compare notes and theories this weekend."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Brooke_045="We'd get the Nobel Prize if we could explain this phenomenon... But even Ms. Grant has no clue..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Brooke_046="You know, science geeks stick together. But honestly, neither of us can explain this phenomenon... It's pretty scary."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_001="Hey, Brooke, how are you?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_020="Back again, Brooke."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_022="I might feel better taking your drone for a quick flight."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_025="Really? I can't fly your drone because I'm going to see "Ape" movies with Warren?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_026="Knock it off, Brooke. Stop being so mean. I'm just going to see ape movies with my friend..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_031="That sounds fun. It would be good for you and Warren to take a road trip after this week..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_032="Oh, he asked you to go to the drive-in with him? Well... that's cool."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_033="I need to find Nathan, have you seen him around?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_036="Nathan was suspended, but he should still be on campus."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_037="It's a school day, so Nathan should be around."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_038="Okay, Brooke. But right now I'm trying to find Nathan..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_039="Come on, Brooke. Don't be that way. Nathan was suspended, but he should still be on campus."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_047="I can't get my limited brain around that eclipse and the beached whales... I was hoping the science department had some ideas."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_048="That makes sense. Two big brains are better than one... or mine."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_049="Oh, he asked you?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeDial_Max_050="I have to go. Talk later, Brooke."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHBrooke_BrookeQP_Brooke_001="Talk to you later, Max."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHChloe_ChloeQP_Chloe_001="Let me know when you have found something!"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_028="Hola, Max. I just figured out that my photos basically suck. I'm a wannabe-artist..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_030="I do feel better now. You are good, Max."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_032="Stay away from my sketchbook? You don't know me, Max. That's like you staying away from your camera. I think I'll just sit here bummed out, thanks."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_034="That makes sense, but not if I can't choose the subjects in class. If only I could draw my photographs... I think I'll just sit here bummed out, thanks."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_036=""Lens pen"... I dig that, Max. That could work for me..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_039="Fortunately, Max, I like bugs."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_043="It will be if I go, man. People here push me into lockers, not dance floors."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_045="They don't deserve anything... I mean, what do they actually do for Blackwell? You're right, Max. Screw them."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_046="Not with you to back me up, Max. Dammit, I will go to the party like it is the end of the world! Okay, maybe I won't go, but... No, I won't do that, but I'll go."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_048="Ooh, I heard a rumor he's actually suspended...
"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_049="You mean lately?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_052="That explains why he looked so pissed off when I saw him leaving campus a few moments ago..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_053="I saw Jefferson talking with Nathan a little while ago, but I try to stay out of his way. I have enough assholes to deal with here."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_055="I don't talk to anybody, Max. But I did actually have a conversation with Brooke. She was very sad about Kate."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_056="I don't talk to anyone, Max. But I did actually have a nice talk with Brooke. She couldn't stop talking about how brave you were on that roof."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_059="We should stop going to class and stage a protest. But that's not going to happen at Blackwell. Yet..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_060="I hear that, Max. She's the sweetest, most genuine person I've ever met... I don't mind getting picked on by Blackwell bro-holes, but don't fuck with Kate."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Daniel_062="Only if I can start the revolution from my sketchbook, Max."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_027="Hey, Daniel. You look bummed out. Are you all right?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_029="You're not here to be a photographer. That's my gig. Look at that sketch you did of me... Incredible. And that's your art, your gift."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_031="Don't give up that easy. Just stay away from your sketchbook for a while. You need to keep taking the shot, as Mr. Jefferson says."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_033="Maybe you should try different subjects... something more like your portraits."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_035="Daniel, your drawings are your photographs. So draw your photos with your eyes and make the camera your "lens pen.""
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_037="Thought I'd bug you again, Daniel."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_040="Let's talk later. Okay, Daniel?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_041="Are you going to the "End Of The World" party tonight?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_042="Screw the Vortex Club. They don't deserve you, Daniel."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_044="That's exactly why you should go to that party. We have to stand up to these Blackwell bullies for Kate. You won't be alone, Daniel."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_047="By the way, have you seen Nathan Prescott?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_050="Yeah, but he's still got to be on campus."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_051="Like anytime today."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_054="Have you talked to anybody about what happened with Kate?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_057="So am I. And angry..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_058="I don't think doing the right thing is "brave", but I appreciate what she means. The most important thing is that Kate gets better... and gets justice."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielDial_Max_061="I like this revolutionary Daniel DaCosta."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielQP1_Daniel_001="Thanks again for making me feel better. Screw the Vortex Club! Let's chat later, Max!"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielQP2_Daniel_002="Thanks again for making me feel better and pushing me to the party. Let's chat later, Max!"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHDaniel_DanielQP3_Daniel_001="Oh, hey, Max. Sorry, I'm still bumming. I'll talk to you later when I'm not so pathetic."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_002="Max, you always show up when I'm talking about you. I'm still bragging about you and the other students making Blackwell surveillance-free."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_015="Max, you always show up when I'm talking about you. And I swear it's not about that petition you didn't sign."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_017="Mr. Prescott has no class at all... after his suspension. I didn't think you were friends."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_018="I'm surprised, Max. I didn't think you and Nathan were exactly friends."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_027="That depends what your definition is... But I'd like to see more friendships at Blackwell, less bullying. Especially after this week."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_028="You're an adult, you can swear, dammit. And I'm glad you did."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_029="I've tried. Nathan is a Prescott, and with that comes a lot of baggage. Too much for one teenager. This week was the proof... Principal Wells did the right thing."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_030="I saw him leaving campus looking angrier than usual. But to be honest, Max, Nathan hasn't been too well lately. You might know more about that than me."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_031="Let's just say I try not to, Max. But I did catch him storming off campus. After what happened this week, I hope you don't see him either... You're not the best student here, but you might be the wisest."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_032="Yes, he does, Max. I did try once... but Mr. Prescott didn't appreciate my help. I did see Nathan leaving the campus, looking angrier than usual... So maybe it's good you haven't found him."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_033="I can tell. You look like you have more than a question on your mind. Maybe asking Nathan isn't such a good idea right now. You hear me, Max?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_034="I saw him sulking off campus earlier. But you look like you have more on your mind than a question..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_036="If I could, I'd be collecting my Nobel Prize in science today. I haven't been able to wrap my mind around that eclipse, much less the snow and whales..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_039="When my friends at NASA tell me they can't explain a solar eclipse|without a single theory as to how or why, maybe it's time to get worried... like they are."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_040="Nothing is beyond science except for our lack of knowledge. We may never know why, but that doesn't change reality."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_042="You and Samuel both. We were talking about that before you came over. Our planet is changing, but it's not mystic. It's erosion."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_045="Well, our shoreline has been receding,|not to mention the daily contamination of the ocean.|That's all you need to kill off sea and wildlife here..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_046="Max, you know how fascinated I am by Arcadia Bay legends, but I haven't found any apocalyptic signs yet... unless you count those "End Of The World" posters."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_047="Unless you know something I don't?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_050="The only wormholes in Arcadia Bay are underground. And Chaos Theory is just that... But if this is about time travel, sign me up."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_051="Oh, Max, nobody even knows who brought the Tobanga here. It was likely stolen from the South Pacific by local fishermen... But I know what you're saying. There's a lot of energy here."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_053="Not after reading that Bradbury story, "A Sound of Thunder." I won't give it away, but it involves dinosaurs and butterflies. Time is like a thread, Max. One tug and it all can unravel."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_056="It's always good talking to you, Max."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_058="Welcome back to the lab, Max."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_059="Oh, Max, I am so sorry you had to go through that... Kate was the sweetest student I've ever met at Blackwell... and they can be so cruel to each other... Do you need to talk to a counselor?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_060="Who needs surveillance when we have Maxine Caulfield? You did a wonderful thing and now we have to make sure Kate gets the help she needs. Do you need to talk to a counselor?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_063="I'm happy to hear that, Max. Just don't ever be afraid to talk to somebody, okay? I wish Kate had come to me... I had no idea what she was going through."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_064="This week hasn't been Blackwell's finest hour. But me and some faculty members won't rest until all the students here feel safe, not bullied."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_066="Shut down that damn Vortex Club for a start. I don't mean to get riled up, but that party should have been postponed... It's extremely tasteless given what happened with Kate."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_069="No, they don't. But membership has its privileges... especially when your father is Blackwell's biggest sponsor. This elitist nonsense has no place here."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_070="Raymond Wells has saved this school from financial disaster and he cares more than you'll know. You're wise, but don't be so quick to judge everybody."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Grant_072="I hear you, Max. I love seeing you and Warren and all my students at your best here. You're all too young to be so cynical... But you truly give me hope."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_001="Hi, Ms. Grant."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_016="I was looking for Nathan Prescott and I thought he might be in your class..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_019="You probably know him better..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_020="No way. I just have to... ask him a question."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_021="Just... study partners. I can't believe he does have friends."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_022="Hell no... Sorry, Ms. Grant."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_023="So you haven't seen Nathan at all?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_024="I know. Nathan needs real help."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_025="Too much..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_026="Me too, Ms. Grant. So you don't know where Nathan is?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_035="I was hoping you could explain some of these crazy things happening in Arcadia Bay..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_037="There must be a scientific explanation... right?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_038="I think this is beyond science."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_041="I am worried about reality... I feel like it's changing right in front of us."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_043="You think that's why all these animals are dying here?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_044="So you don't think this could be some kind of prophecy or something?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_048="What about wormholes and Chaos Theory... time travel stuff..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_049="I wonder if the Tobanga knows more than anybody here..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_052="Would you really change time?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_054="I don't think surveillance would have helped Kate Marsh."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_055="I'm sorry, Ms. Grant, I have to get going. I'll see you later."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_057="Hi again, Ms. Grant."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_061="No, thanks, Ms. Grant. I have my best friend and my parents... for now."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_062="Blackwell Academy needs the help. There's something terrible going on here. You see it, right?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_065="Kate was drugged at the Vortex Club party and bullied by them,|until she ended up on the roof.|How do you stop that?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_067="Do the Prescotts have anything to do with the Vortex Club? They don't get all their money from car washes."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_068="So why doesn't Principal Wells stop the party? To be honest, he doesn't seem to care about what's going on here."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantDial_Max_071="You're right... I just wish this could be the school that I dreamed about before I came here."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHGrant_GrantQP_Grant_001="Let's talk again soon, Max."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_016="Yes, it has, Samuel. How are you?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_018="Sorry to bother you again, Samuel."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_020="More questions than answers..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_023="I definitely have questions about what's happening to the animals in Arcadia Bay."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_024="I still have a million questions about what's happening to Arcadia Bay."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_026="I'm sorry, I better get going now."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_029="Have you seen Nathan Prescott around?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_030="You don't sound sad, Samuel."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_031="He deserved it. And more."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_032="Whoa, you really don't like Nathan. How come?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_033="So what do you know about Nathan?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_038="What do you really know about him?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_039="Well, okay. 'Nuff said. You know a lot of Blackwell secrets, so I thought you could help me."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_042="Blackwell is so sad and quiet since Kate... isn't here anymore."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_043="I actually just talked to Kate Marsh in the hospital. She's doing so much better."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_049="Samuel, you're the eyes of Blackwell. Did you know Kate was being bullied?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_050="It could have gone either way... Samuel, do you think that we each have a destiny?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_052="I believe you..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_054="Do you ever talk with David Madsen?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_057="That's how David operates."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_059="Why do you say that?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_060="He wishes he could..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_063="I think you have better vision than both of us."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_065="What do you think about all those dying birds?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_067="Is that cool with the Tobanga?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_068="What happened to them?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_071="It's so ominous."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_073="How can anybody explain all those poor beached whales..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_074="I'm glad to see your squirrels are still healthy and happy on the campus."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_077="Not as long as you're here to take care of them, Samuel."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_078="Do you think this is some kind of eco-disaster, or..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_079="They're not alone these days... I feel so powerless."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_084="You think so, Samuel?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_085="I keep thinking that Rachel Amber has a few answers if we can find her..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_086="Even though Ms. Grant likes me, I have zero science skills to explain that eclipse."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_087="I'd rather be in her class than in the Vortex Club."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_091="She's not the only one..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_093="How do you know that? I'm genuinely curious."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_094="Beginning of what?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_098="Do you think she is alive?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_099="That's the real secret... where is she?"
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Max_102="But..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_015="How are you doing, Max? Been a tough week, I know."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_017="Sad and confused, like everybody else in Arcadia Bay. You look like you have a lot of questions, too..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_019="There's no bother here, Max."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_021="Samuel is always here to talk."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_022="Oh, many do. These poor creatures have no choice in what happens to them..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_025="That must be why Ms. Grant says you're one of her favorite students at Blackwell."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_027="That would be hard, since he was suspended..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_028="I try not to."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_034="Nathan hurts people. The end."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_035="Samuel tries not to judge people, but Nathan shouldn't be here. Maybe he's supposed to be here, though."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_036="Samuel likes everybody... until they give him a reason not to. He did."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_037="I know enough to not want to know any more."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_040="Not enough to help you, Max. I truly wish I could... I see what you're doing..."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_041="Max, I'm a custodian, not a psychic... I can only help by warning you to be careful."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_044="Yes, you can tell the campus is different now... And you reached out to her when everybody turned away."
Cue_E4_5B_CampusB_CHSamuel_SamuelDial_Samuel_045="Because of you, Max. That was quite a rescue."

Cue_E4_8B_MenToilets_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_009="No, it's more like somebody who's in pain. I'm sorry, Justin. But you're a cool, considerate guy and you're going to find somebody just as cool, minus the drama."
Cue_E4_8B_MenToilets_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_010="Rachel Amber won't be coming either."
Cue_E4_8B_MenToilets_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_012="Good for Rachel. I wish I could have seen that..."
Cue_E4_8B_MenToilets_CHJustin_Phase01_Max_014="Uh, no. I- I'm cool, Justin. And I have to get going. Maybe you should go chill somewhere else."
Cue_E4_8B_MenToilets_CHJustin_Quickphase_Justin_001="No, seriously, I am outta here. When everything isn't so fuzzy..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_AlyssaFall_IGE_Alyssa_010="Good grief! Give the girl a break!"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_AlyssaFall_IGE_TeenBoy01_007="or win…"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_AlyssaFall_IGE_TeenBoy02_006="Eh, epic fail!"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_AlyssaWarn_RTC_Alyssa_020="I'm on it."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_AlyssaWarn_RTC_Alyssa_030="Again?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_AlyssaWarn_RTC_Alyssa_040="Whoa!"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_AlyssaWarn_RTC_Alyssa_050="Of course, my object angel has stepped up every single time to protect me from the cruel world. Thank you again, Mystic Max!"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_AlyssaWarn_RTC_Alyssa_060="Of course, you stepped up to protect me from another humiliating moment like yesterday. Thank you, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_AlyssaWarn_RTC_Alyssa_070="That was too close. Thanks, Max! I wish you had been around earlier this week..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_AlyssaWarn_RTC_Max_010="Alyssa, incoming!
"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_NotWarned_Alyssa_002="Yes, I just got tagged by a water weenie and fell in the pool. I'm groovy. Of course, this is the one time you didn't warn me, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_NotWarned_Alyssa_003="Yes, I just got tagged by a water weenie and fell in the pool. I'm great. I guess I can't expect you to warn me like you did last time."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_NotWarned_Alyssa_004="Yes, I just got tagged by a water weenie and fell in the pool. I'm "Queen of the World"... And you're always nearby when I'm targeted. Maybe you could warn me one of these days, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_NotWarned_Max_001="Oh, shit, Alyssa! Are you okay?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Quickphase_Alyssa_001="Thanks again, Max, now I can enjoy this shitty party."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Quickphase_Alyssa_002="Not now, Max. I'm soaking wet, thanks to those morons and their stupid pool noodle."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_001="I'm surprised to see you here."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_003="You scared me for a sec. I was ready to duck. Didn't think you'd come back. "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_005="I know. I only came because Warren was coming and I needed something else to vent about. This party is such a tribute to Kate's spirit."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_007="I'm just happy she's drawing again. She seems much better and her mother is being so supportive for a change...Kate deserves that."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_009="Look how fast people here forgot about Kate. They'll find some new Blackwell drama and forget about her video... So it goes. "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_011="I can tell you know some serious shit by your face. You don't have to tell me now, but please let me know if I can help. Like you helped me. "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_019="I really don't know, but surely in the VIP section... like it's a New York club."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_021="Why, when I have Max Caulfield at my side? Good luck."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_023="I know. This week was so shitty that I just wanted to be around a bunch of people trying to have a good time...even if I hate most of them."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_025="She must know I'd punch her in the face. I probably should, just for Vortex Club posterity..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_027="I didn't know her, but I hope she's safe and sound."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_029="Max, you look kind of tense. Maybe you should go crash. You had a tough week too with Kate... plus having to save my ass all the time."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_031="You kinda are a superhero. You always choose to help me. It reminds me of the only poem I can quote, by Robert Frost."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_033="Okay, but this is like poet karaoke, so don't cringe: "I shall be telling this with a sigh. Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I... I took the one less traveled by. And that has made all the difference." "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_035="Thanks for not cringing. And thanks for watching my back. Blackwell would be so much cooler if we all did that for everybody else...but you're a great start, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Alyssa_037="That sounded ominous. But I promise. Be careful out there, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_002="Yes, I'm back."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_004="I'm surprised to see anybody here, considering that Kate just killed herself in front of everybody."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_006="I'm surprised that Blackwell is having a party after Kate almost jumped off a roof. I guess people are happy that Kate is "okay" now and they can party again..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_008="I saw that the video got taken down, so I hope nobody posts it anywhere else... or is that naive?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_010="Kate deserves revenge. We have to make sure this doesn't happen to anybody else at Blackwell... "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_012="Alyssa, I have to find Nathan. Have you seen him?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_020="Thanks, Alyssa. Watch out for yourself."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_022="Look at this... I'm at my first and only Vortex Club party. "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_024="Victoria doesn't seem to hassle you like she does me or... Kate."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_026="I think Rachel Amber would agree..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_028="Uh... yeah. I'll talk to you later, Alyssa."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_030="I'm so glad I could warn you about all those sneak attacks. "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_032=" I could use one moment of poetry right now."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_034="That was beautiful, Alyssa. And it's exactly what I needed to hear."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_036="I wish I had time to hear it... Promise you'll tell me if... next time we meet. "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHAlyssa_Warned_Max_038="No doubt, but I actually have to go now. Talk to you later, Alyssa."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_002="Max, I didn't expect to see you at a Vortex Club party."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_004="No, I haven't seen him. And I'm not looking for him, so I most likely won't tonight. I just hate that scrub... and his club."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_006="No homework. Boredom. Waiting. "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_008="Then I don't have to pretend like I care anymore."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_010="I will. He left already, but we're going to map out our drive-in date later. Warren wants to go to dinner first, so that'll be fun. Is that cool with you, Max?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_013="Thanks, Max. Though I feel selfish talking about a boy, considering Kate and the Arcadia Bay eco-meltdown..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_014="Why? You're the one going out with him."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_016="I know... I get salty when things don't go my way. I'm selfish, while you go on a roof to help save your friend."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_017="No, I was talking to Daniel...he asked me to go with him to the Portland Art Museum this weekend... "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_019="I'm more into science than art, but what kind of a selfish fangirl would miss a Miyazaki exhibition?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_020="No, but we're going to map out our drive-in date later. I was just talking to Daniel about a road trip next week to the Portland Art Museum."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_022="I'm more into science than art, but what kind of a selfish fangirl would miss a Miyazaki exhibition?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_024="You seem so wise and... kind of invincible this week. I think that snow and eclipse gave you superpowers. Check to see if you can fly."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_026="Max, if I saw a double moon out there, I would assume it really was the end of the world."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_028="I don't know. It would be pretty kick-ass to battle supervillains over Arcadia Bay..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Brooke_030="And so are we, Max. So let's plan a drone date next week."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_001="Hello, Brooke. "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_003="I didn't expect that either, but I really need to find Nathan. Have you..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_005="So why are you here tonight?  "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_007="You're not the only one. Maybe this party will be the "End Of The Vortex Club"..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_009="Have you seen Warren tonight?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_011="Yes, it's great. Brooke, I'm happy for you. And Warren. I'd like to see you happy instead of waiting."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_015="Brooke, enough. I'm sorry Warren asked me to the movies, but you don't need to give me an attitude. I'd like to think I'm your friend. "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_018="Oh, that is so sweet. I bet Daniel will be a great museum guide..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_021="Oh, that is so cool. He needs a friend. I bet Daniel will be a great musuem guide..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_023=" You're not selfish, Brooke. You're just trying to live your life without all this bullshit. Like all of us here..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_025="Only with your drone. By the way, did you see that crazy double moon out there earlier?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_027="I don't think having superpowers would make my life easier... With great power comes great bullshit."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Phase01_Max_029="Well, the night is still young, Brooke."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Quickphase_Brooke_001="Let's make detailed plans later, okay?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHBrooke_Quickphase_Brooke_002="Can't talk now, Max, waiting for a boy..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Daniel_002="Yes! Max makes an entrance! I only came to the party because of you!"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Daniel_004="No, I've been hanging with Brooke since I got here. Max, are you okay? Your face looks so... serious."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Daniel_006="You look like you're on a secret mission..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Daniel_008="It seems like it never ends, huh? "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Daniel_010="Well, if you want to hang out with Brooke and me, we're here for you."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Daniel_011="Oh, Max. You need a Blackwell break. I'm taking Brooke to a Miyazaki show in Portland if you want to come along... The more the merrier!"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Daniel_013="Well, I'll be celebrating someday in a museum, Max. Adios."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Max_001="Hi, Daniel."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Max_003="I'm glad to see you out and about. By the way, have you seen Nathan Prescott tonight?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Max_005="I know. I'm not in party mode tonight."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Max_007="It's nothing. Just residue from all the Blackwell drama..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Max_009="This is where it's going to end... for Rachel's sake."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Phase01_Max_012="Thanks, Daniel. I have to stay on my mission now. I hope you stay on yours and become a great artist. "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHDaniel_Quickphase_Daniel_001="I have to hit "el baño" so let's talk later, Max!"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_002="Max, you're the only person I don't mind seeing right now."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_004="I've avoided almost everybody here tonight. Uh, why are you looking for Nathan?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_006="Like what happened to Kate..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_008="Really? You look pretty fucking intense. Is Nathan bothering you?"
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_009="Oh wait, I did see Nathan today, nursing a busted face. I had dreams that somebody finally kicked his ass... "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_011="I have dreams that somebody finally kicks his ass one day."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_013="Yes! Give it up for brother Warren! Now all we have to do is drive all these goddamn Prescott vampires out of town."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_015="I call it the "Vortex Cult." Look at this crap... dress code? VIP section? Elitist bullshit."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_017="I met him once at a Bigfoots game... mean fucking bastard. Oh man, he explains Nathan."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Luke_019="No, thank you. For helping Kate. And for keeping it real. Peace out."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_001="Luke, I almost didn't see you."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_003="I was looking for Nathan..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_005="I wanted to make sure he's not going to... do anything tonight."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_007="No big deal. "
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_010="Luke, sometimes dreams come true. Warren gave him an epic beatdown."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_012="Luke, sometimes dreams come true. Today I saw Warren give Nathan an epic headbutt."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_014="That will be hard to do when the Prescotts own the town... and the Vortex Club."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_016="I think Sean Prescott wants to drive all of us out of town... or into Pan Estates."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Phase01_Max_018="Preach it, brother Luke. Okay, I have to get going. Thanks for seeing me..."
Cue_E4_8B_Pool_CHLuke_Quickphase_Luke_001="I'm still trying to lay low here, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BooingVictoria_Stella_010="You don't deserve to win!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BooingVictoria_Stella_020="Boo, Victoria!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BooingVictoria_Stella_030="Victoria Bologna!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BooingVictoria_Stella_040="You suck, Victoria!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BooingVictoria_TeenMale01_010="Boo! Come on, what the fuck? Plug it back in!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BooingVictoria_TeenMale01_020="Come on!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BrookeDaniel_IGE_Brooke_010="It’s so nice to chat up another anime geek..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BrookeDaniel_IGE_Brooke_030="You are. That’s what I like about Warren..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BrookeDaniel_IGE_Brooke_050="Yeah, but so am I."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BrookeDaniel_IGE_Daniel_020="Oh yes, I’m a multi-purpose geek..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BrookeDaniel_IGE_Daniel_040="He’s more into science though, right?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_BrookeDaniel_IGE_Daniel_060="I like science fiction..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_Brooke_IGE_Brooke_010="This party needs a drone."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_Brooke_IGE_Brooke_020="And what is the point of this party exactly?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DJSpeakerStops_IGE_DJ_010="Whoa, whoa, what the fuck is going on?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DJSpeakerStops_IGE_DJ_020="Okay, okay! Whoa, whoa! Who stopped the music, okay?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DJSpeakerStops_IGE_DJ_030="Hey, you! Yes, you! What the hell are you doing over there?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DanaTrevor_IGE_Dana_010="You dance worse than my dad!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DanaTrevor_IGE_Dana_030="Okay, now that’s hot! Bust a move!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DanaTrevor_IGE_Trevor_020="Yes, but can he do this?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DanaTrevor_IGE_Trevor_040="Trevor 2: Electric Boogaloo!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DontWarnVictoria_Max_010="Never mind. It was good talking to you, Victoria. As usual."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DontWarnVictoria_Max_030="At least tell me where Nathan is."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DontWarnVictoria_Max_050="Principal Wells wanted to see us Monday. It's no big deal."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DontWarnVictoria_Max_070="Au revoir…"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DontWarnVictoria_Victoria_020="Eat a dick, Max. You're just jealous of me because I actually do the things you can't. I put my photographs out there, while you hide behind your lame retro-selfies."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DontWarnVictoria_Victoria_040="Uh, why do you want to know?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_DontWarnVictoria_Victoria_060="Then why ask me? I haven’t even seen him tonight. Adios."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_EnjoyingParty_TeenBoy_010="Plug that shit back in! We want the bass, the, the fucking bass, let me hear that! Ah, this is bullshit, come on! We came to party! Give us that heavy beat!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_EnjoyingParty_TeenGirl_010="Oh, my God!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_EnjoyingParty_TeenGirl_020="Where is the alcohol?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_EnjoyingParty_TeenGirl_030="I love this song!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_EnjoyingParty_TeenGirl_040="Marcia! Marcia!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_GirlTalkMax_IGE_TeenGirl03_010="Oh, I’m shocked to see you tonight, Max....But you deserve a party."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_Hayden_IGE_Hayden_010="Is it me or is everybody here all fuzzy ?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_Hayden_IGE_Hayden_020="Is it me or is everybody here all fuzzy?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_Hayden_IGE_Hayden_030="I am so wasted. But so are you two."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffArrive_Chloe_100="Let’s get the hell out of here, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffArrive_Jefferson_010="So you made it, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffArrive_Jefferson_030="Um... are you both okay? You look like you're on a mission..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffArrive_Jefferson_050="Aha. I didn't know you were pals with him. I haven't seen him since this afternoon... He seemed pretty upset. I think he's still quite upset over the whole Kate situation."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffArrive_Jefferson_070="Let's talk later, Max. I have to announce the winner of the contest. I do wish you would have entered. You have to build up that résumé and portfolio, but I know you will."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffArrive_Jefferson_090="Okay, excuse me. I’m almost on..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffArrive_Max_020="Oh, hey, Mr. Jefferson..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffArrive_Max_040="Oh, I was just looking for Nathan."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffArrive_Max_060="Yeah, that makes sense."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffArrive_Max_080="Thanks, I hope so."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeechReaction1_Chloe_020="Who fucking cares? Rachel is still dead. And I want Nathan's punk ass... now!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeechReaction1_Courtney_010="Great, Mr. Jefferson! You're so hot!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeechReaction1_Dana_010="Ah, Mr. Jefferson! Sexy! Oh…"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeechReaction1_Max_010="Victoria won. Big surprise. I can't believe she blackmailed Jefferson...|Well... yes, I can."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeechReaction1_Max_030="Me too. Let’s go check out the dormitories."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_010="Okay, everybody calm down.|Thank you, thank you... I appreciate it.|I don't want to get in the way of the party, but it's time to announce the winner of the "Everyday Heroes" contest."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_030="Before I do, I want to thank everybody who entered their photograph... and everybody who thought about entering."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_040="Now, this is the most important step in being an artist—sharing your work with the world. All of you represent Blackwell Academy, and everything our school stands for."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_050="As far as I'm concerned, you're all "Everyday Heroes"!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_060="The envelope, please..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_070="And the winner is…"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_080="Oh my, what a shocker... Victoria Chase!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_140="Thank you, Victoria. And speaking of Kate…"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_150="You're all aware this party was almost canceled because of what happened this week."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_160="But the administration wisely decided that you deserve this gathering… and the Vortex Club has done so much for Blackwell."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_170="Be aware that everything you do tonight is under heightened scrutiny and basically, you need to act like responsible adults here."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Jefferson_180="So now that the old man has spoken, please enjoy yourselves tonight. It is the perfect October night for a wicked pool party. Class dismissed!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Taylor_020="You are so hot!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Victoria_090="Oh my God!"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Victoria_100="Thank you so much, Mr. Jefferson. It was your incredible photography that brought me to Blackwell and I hope I can live up to your name... and fame. I also want to thank all the students for being so dedicated in their pursuit."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Victoria_110="And I'd like to dedicate this prize to the memory of Kate Marsh... She was the real "everyday hero" of Blackwell..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Victoria_120="And I'd like to dedicate this prize to Kate Marsh... She is the real "everyday hero" of Blackwell. And I can't wait for her to come back."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JeffSpeech_Victoria_130="Thank you."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JustinDrunk_IGE_Justin_010="Hey, Max. What are you doing in here?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_JustinDrunk_IGE_Justin_020="If I get sick now...I can drink more later..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_Luke_IGE_Luke_010="I’d pay money to see Warren kicking Nathan’s ass..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_Luke_IGE_Luke_020="I just wish someone would kick Nathan’s ass..."

Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_SpeakChloe_Chloe_020="He’s definitely not upstairs or in the lockers."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_SpeakChloe_Chloe_040="Then let’s bail. Nathan can’t hide anymore."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_SpeakChloe_Max_010="There you are.|Chloe, Nathan isn't here. Nobody has seen him tonight."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_SpeakChloe_Max_030="Damn, maybe he's hiding in his dorm."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_SpeakStella_Stella_010="Hey, Max, welcome to the "End Of The World." Do you want me to check anything in?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList01_Courtney_020="Max! Our guest star arrives fashionably late! Say “Bonsoir” to the “End of the World”! Even though you flaked on my party make-over...You still get special access to the Vortex Club VIP lounge…"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList01_Courtney_040="Oh, that little asshole just made her last mistake. She thinks she’s Victoria. Buh bye. Now, let’s go make an official VIP entrance, Max Factor! Get it… ?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList01_Courtney_050="Hey Sarah, do you know that I personally put Max’s name on the list? So you like, decide to block her from coming in while I’m taking a break? You’re not in charge here."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList01_Courtney_070="Oh my God, you’re done. And you’re off the list, permanently. Welcome to the Vortex Club."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList01_Max_010="Hey, Courtney, how are you?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList01_Max_030="You better let your minion know since she won't let me pass."

Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList02_Courtney_040="You got on the list? That’s very…unlikely but let’s check it out. Follow me…"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList02_Courtney_050="Sarah, our friend Max here claims she’s on the list. Just for shits and giggles, let’s see."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList02_Courtney_060="No way…"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList02_Courtney_080="Oh. My. God. Do you think I’m that dumb, Max? That’s not even my handwriting and I’m in charge of the list! Victoria is right, you are so fucking weird! Well, this is the closest you will ever get to the Vortex Club again. Promise. Yes, you can leave now, Max. The party’s over."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList02_Max_010="Hey, Courtney, how are you?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPCourtneyList02_Max_030="I didn't want to be alone tonight after this week, so I'm even on the guest list. But "Zuul the Gatekeeper" won't let me pass."

Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPDenied_IGE_Bouncer_030="Then she must have erased it later."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPDenied_IGE_Bouncer_050="No, because your name isn’t on the list, asshole."

Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPEntrance_VIPKeeper_080="No, you listen. Courtney is supposed to be the VIP gatekeeper, not me. So please go."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPEntrance_VIPKeeper_100="Victoria specifically told me not to let you in. Nice try. Too bad you're not a member."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_VIPEntrance_VIPKeeper_120="No, you listen. Courtney is supposed to be the VIP gatekeeper, not me. So please go."

Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Max_010="Victoria, listen to me... your life is in serious danger. I know Nathan is your friend, but he is truly unstable and dangerous. He did drug Kate at that party so he could take her some place... dark."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Max_030="That I don't know yet. But it was enough to make Kate want to die... And I think you're next."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Max_050="They’re not little anymore. They’re deadly. I don’t care if you hate me or not, but you have to believe me."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Max_090="Just make sure you stay away from him and stick close to your friends tonight, okay?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Max_110="I’ve got my own protection."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Max_130="I will. Thanks, Victoria."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Victoria_020="What? Nice try, Max. But I don’t believe you. And why would he do that?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Victoria_040="Max, that is crazy. Nathan is like one of my best friends. Yes, he takes serious meds, but that's not his fault. His family treats him like a total freak, just because he has little meltdowns."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Victoria_060="You could have been a major bitch to me when I got hit with that paint... and I deserved it."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Victoria_070="Max, I don't hate you... I actually think you're one of the coolest people at Blackwell... Weird, but cool. You just don't know it yet. Maybe I'm jealous because you don't give a shit what anybody thinks. And I do."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Victoria_080="To be honest, Nathan has been freaking me out lately... He’s not here and I haven’t seen him."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Victoria_100="I'll let you boss me around this one time. And I have other people I can go to for protection. Thanks for telling me this, Max. If what you said is true... then you be careful, too."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Victoria_120="Um, text me if you need anything..."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_Believe_Victoria_140="Au revoir."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Max_010="Victoria, enough of this high school bullshit. We're adults now. So listen to me, your life is in serious danger. I know you're close to Nathan... but he is truly unstable and dangerous. He did drug Kate at that party so he could take her some place... dark."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Max_030="Touché. But I am not fucking around here."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Max_050="They’re not little anymore. They’re deadly. I don’t care if you hate me or not, but you have to believe me."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Max_070="Now will you listen?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Max_100="Oh, Victoria, please don't do this. Especially after what happened with Kate... Can't you see I'm serious?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Max_120="Au revoir…"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Victoria_020="Oh my God... and I'm the drama queen?"
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Victoria_040="Sorry, but no, no way. Nathan is like one of my best friends. Yes, he takes serious meds but that's not his fault. His family treats him like a total freak, just because he has little meltdowns."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Victoria_060="I don't believe anything you say. You're full of shit. "Oh, hi, I'm Max Caulfield and I'm so sensitive that butterflies make me cry.""
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Victoria_080="No, I won’t."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Victoria_090="You're just pissed because you didn't enter a photo in the contest,|and that Mr. Jefferson is going to pick me. A real artist would have busted ass to win... but you just want to take your little retro-selfies. That is so fucking lame and lazy, Max. Just go find a community college."
Cue_E4_8B_SwimPool_WarnVictoria_DontBelieve_Victoria_110="That's your problem, Max. This is a party. And it's the "end of the world," so I am going to get so wasted even you won't bother me anymore. I'll let Nathan know if he finally shows up. Adios."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_001="Yay, Max! I can't believe you showed up! Why didn't you tell me? We could have dressed up together!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_003="Hell no, I've been dancing with Trevor. Come on and dance with us! Look at Trevor trying to bust a move!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_005="I think we are. He's so different than Logan. We actually talk about life... And he knows how to be safe."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_007="Great! This has been the worst fucking week of my life, so I needed to act like a carefree student tonight...For Kate..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_009="I will if I want to have fun... I still feel sorry for him. He needs help, but not from his family..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_011="Uh, rich. And rich. And a dickhead, according to Nathan. The Prescotts can't buy a happy family... or a happy club."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_014="I know... Juliet wrote a story describing it like a cult and I'm starting to think she was right... It's not fun anymore."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_016="I don't need any club to be cool or have friends. Look at you...Plus I like hanging with Trevor and his skater friends. No drama!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Dana_018="Thanks. The boy cannot dance, though... look at that!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Max_002="As you can tell by my outfit, I was in a hurry... Dana, have you seen Nathan around?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Max_004="You guys look really happy together..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Max_006="How is the "End Of The World" going?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Max_008="I hear you, Dana. But I want you to avoid Nathan if you see him, okay?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Max_010="What do you know about his dad, Sean Prescott?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Max_012="The Vortex Club is also enabling him."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Max_015="Sounds like you're ready for a change."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Phase01_Max_017="That sounds like a plan, Dana. I'm glad Trevor is with you tonight."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHDana_Quickphase_Dana_001="Max, if you're not going to shake that booty, we'll have to talk after I do! Love ya!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_002="Look, up in the sky—it's Super Max, here to save the party!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_004="Oh, hey, Max... I didn't think you'd actually come tonight..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_006="I just vaped some dank OG bud, so I can barely see you... or these hotties next to me. You want a hit?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_008="Come on, come on, I would kill to see you baked. Get that stick out of your ass. You need to get high more than anybody I know... next to me."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_010="Me too. He's supposed to be bringing some special party favors... I hope... at the party... you actually plan to party at the party."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_012="I guess you have to go ask everybody here... or you can sit down and take a quick hit."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_014="God, go ask her yourself. I would, but like I said... I'm fucking ripped."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_017="What doesn't he pay for? The Prescotts shit money. How else could we afford DJ Doomsday to spin?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_019="Whatever. I'm in this world to have fun... try it sometime, Max. I finally get you and Dana to come out to a Vortex Club party, but you just want to lecture me... Gee, thanks, "Mr. Madsen.""
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Hayden_021="I think that's your job, Max. Come back when you're ready to have fun..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_001="What's up, Hayden?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_003="Have you seen Nathan?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_005="Well, I didn't think anybody would want to party | after Kate Marsh killed herself this week... Have you seen Nathan? "
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_007="No, thanks."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_009="No, I want to find Nathan."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_011="Not this week. So, has anybody here seen Nathan?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_013="What about Victoria?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_015="Maybe you better take it easy tonight."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_016="Hayden, does Sean Prescott pay for the Vortex Club parties?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_018="The Prescott family is literally making you dance..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Phase01_Max_020="How much fun did Kate have at your last party? Listen, Hayden... just watch out for Nathan tonight."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHHayden_Quickphase_Hayden_001="Is that you, Max? You look all fuzzy... Wow, I am baked..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Logan_002="Max, all right! I'll talk after you shake that booty for me!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Logan_004="I can't even get Victoria or Taylor to twerk... and you want to hang with Nathan? Why?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Logan_006="You should talk to his dad then. Bro has got more money than God... and he spends it on the Vortex Club, not the losers over there in the cheap seats."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Logan_008="Whoa, Max is dropping serious attitude on the dance floor!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Logan_010="Ask Victoria, she always knows where he is. Why don't you ever want to see me, Max? You're so cute and we never really talk..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Logan_012="Bro, you are giving me the full body tackle... I already feel like an ass for flaking on Dana. How can I be an un-dick now?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Logan_015="The next Bigfoots game. We could go out to the field, I could show you some moves... give you a touchdown..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Logan_017="Damn, that was way more exciting than a dance... Catch ya later, Max!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Max_001="Logan, can I talk to you for a second?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Max_003="Uh, no. Have you seen Nathan?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Max_005="Business."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Max_007="None of your business."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Max_009="Logan, this is a swimming pool. In other words, you haven't seen Nathan."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Max_011="Logan, you're such a dick. You bailed on Dana when she was pregnant, right when she needed you most. Now you're trying to mack on me? Are you proud of yourself?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Max_013="You could start by not trying to sex up every female in front of you. The rest is your choice... Use it well, bro."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Max_014="Talk about what?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Max_016="Logan, don't make me hurt you."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Phase01_Max_018="Oh, and don't ever touch Daniel DaCosta again. You will regret it. Now excuse me."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHLogan_Quickphase_Logan_001="Can't talk now, Max. You actually made me think."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Max_003="Taylor, have you seen Nathan yet?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Max_006="What does Victoria say about that?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Max_008="How has Nathan been scary?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Max_010="Is this why you want to be in the Vortex Club?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Max_012="Kate was dosed at the last Vortex Club party by Nathan, so you should avoid any drink here tonight."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Max_014="Why did you come tonight? Membership dues?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Max_016="I do have to go now. Look out for yourself, Taylor. And give my best to your mom."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Max_018="Just keep on dancing for Victoria, Taylor. And stay away from Nathan."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Max_020="Eat shit, Taylor. Enjoy the end of the world."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_001="Max! Look at you go, girl! "
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_002="Oh my God. Max. Seriously? What are you doing here?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_004="No... that's fine by me. He's been getting like too buggy... and kind of scary. Victoria might know..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_005="If I did, it's none of your business. This is a VIP area, so you should get back to the bleachers. "
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_007="She blows it off, but Vic is close with Nathan. They're more like brother-sister. Or something...She really cares about him."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_009="I've always thought he was a creeper. Fun, but...you can tell he doesn't give a shit about anybody. "
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_011="No, Max. I'm like far from home at a great school. I want to learn things, make friends and party...but when Kate was on the roof, I knew I had gone too far..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_013="Trust me, I won't even drink my own water when Nathan is around now. He's a pharmacy simulator."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_015="Don't laugh, but I had a weird vibe this might actually be the last Vortex Club party...End Of The World, right?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_017="Oh, thanks, Max. She's doing great after her surgery. I'm glad to know you're looking out for us too..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_019="Like, thanks for your concern."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Phase01_Taylor_021="Okay, like, maybe I will. Uh..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Quickphase_Taylor_001="Let's talk after this song, cool?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHTaylor_Quickphase_Taylor_002="I'm not giving you dance lessons. Go."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_001="Go fuck your selfie, Victoria. I don't have time for this bullshit."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_004="Do you even have a clue what's going on at Blackwell?"

Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_006="Kate Marsh tried to kill herself in front of you and me... everybody here!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_008="Oh, I will. You didn't help Kate at that party. You knew she was totally wasted. Then you sent the video to everybody, just to twist the knife."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_010="Then shame on you. And you know Kate was dosed, no matter how much you deny it. That's why she ended up on that roof... and you made sure to take one last video of her, right?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_013="I bet that comforts Kate's family... I don't even know how you sleep at night."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_014="I blame Nathan for dosing Kate, but nobody at that party even cared that she was so wasted."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_016="Some humanity, Victoria."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_020="This is bigger than a problem child."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_021="I don't blame you, Victoria, but you know Kate had a church group and that she didn't party. So why did you send out that video?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_023="More than stupid. It's mean... hateful. Kate never did anything to you.|And that didn't stop you from taking one last video of her on the roof."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_026="I believe you, Victoria. I saw the nice postcard you sent to Kate. But I don't understand you."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_027="I believe you, Victoria. But I don't understand you..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_030="Your photographs suck, Victoria. You make fun of my selfies, but most of your photos are basically headshots. I don't think Richard Avedon has anything to worry about."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_032="Uh, yeah, I saw you try to blackmail Mr Jefferson last night because you're so incredible. That was so pathetic, Victoria."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_035="Like Mr. Jefferson gives a shit about you either. I mean, have you ever even watched his body language when you try to cuddle up to him? Sad face."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_038="Is that what you were trying to tell Mr. Jefferson last night?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_040="Saw... and heard."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_042="I hope you win fair."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_044="You have talent, Victoria. You don't have to push people out of your way."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_046="No, it's art. You don't have to play their way. Look at me, I got the judge of the contest suspended. "
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_047="No, it's art. You don't have to play their way.|Mr. Jefferson doesn't talk that way and he's famous."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_050="I don't either, but that's the choice you make."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_051="Yes, you are. But we shouldn't have to choose between talent and kindness. I hope."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_053="Good. I have real friends, I wouldn't want a fake one."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_055="Who do you think set up the paint can to fall? It wasn't Samuel, dumbass."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_057="Who do you think set up the paint can to fall? It wasn't Samuel, dumbass. And you trashed my room after, so stop whining."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_059="And that would have been bad. You're right, Victoria... for once."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_062="Guess I'll never be a member of the Vortex Club..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_064="Maybe, but who says we have to be enemies?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_066="That would be us, Victoria."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_068="I don't think that's gonna happen... but not for the reasons you think."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_070="Why the hell not? We're both into art and photography, both kind of weird and pretentious. If we hung out without attitude, we'd get along fine."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_072="You should have asked me. It would have been cool to compare photo notes."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_076="You might be right."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Max_078="I actually hope so, Victoria."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_002="Real cute, Max. And after I apologized to you the other day..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_003="Real cute, Max. You still pissed about me taking your picture? "
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_007="That's not my fault, Max. Don't you even try to blame me!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_009="Wow. Are you kidding me? I didn't make her drink that wine! Nobody pushed her tongue into everybody's mouth. I watched her, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_011="I deleted that video from my phone, Max. I didn't know what to do, okay? Sorry. "
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_012="I deleted that video from my phone, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_015="It's a fucking party, everybody is wasted! What do you want from me? "
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_017="You're the one who got suspended, Max. And I'm the only person here who cares what Nathan is going through! So I'm not the only problem child here."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_018="I'm the only person here who cares what Nathan is going through...I'm not the only problem child at Blackwell.  "
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_019="Well, you got Nathan busted out of Blackwell, so you should be happy. And I'm the only person here who cares what Nathan is going through."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_022="Oh God... I swear we weren't even going to do it. Then we had some wine and got stupid."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_024="I deleted that from my phone. Max, I saw Kate Marsh die...|I swear it didn't feel real to me.|I kept thinking, "Did I cause this? Did I?"|I've felt like shit ever since."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_025="I deleted that from my phone. Maybe I'm not her friend, but I didn't get off on Kate attempting suicide. I'm not evil, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_028="I'm not perfect, okay? I'm a teenager at an art school. I'm only here to become a photographer and get famous."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_029="That makes both of us, Max. I always feel like I have to overcompensate. For what, I have no clue. I'm only here to become a photographer, not president."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_031="Oh, you did not just say that.|I can't wait to see you choke when Mr. Jefferson selects my incredible photo for the "Everyday Heroes" contest."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_033="Uh... no, creeper. We were talking about the contest.|And you're just jealous again because you got Mr. Jefferson kicked out of going to San Francisco.|Like he cares about you."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_034="Uh... no, creeper. We were talking about the contest. You didn't even enter a picture, so stop acting like you care. "
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_036="Ha ha."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_037="By the way, nobody says we have to be friends, Max."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_039="You saw me talking to him?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_041="We were just talking about how excited he is for the "Everyday Heroes" contest. That doesn't mean I'm going to win or anything."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_043="We'll see...And Max, I know you don't like me either, so it's not like we have to be friends or anything."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_045="You don't understand. My parents own a gallery. I know how this art game has to be played... it's brutal."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_048="On point, Max...|Thanks for admitting again that I have some talent. Not that I think I always do."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_049="Yeah, Mr. Jefferson probably won't be choosing my photo. I'm not as talented as I thought."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_052="Hard to believe, but I don't always make the best choices. Do you think it's, like, fate we're not supposed to be friends?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_054="Oh, right. You're the faker, acting like you cared when I was covered in that paint."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_056="You try to act like all shy and humble... You took a picture of me covered in paint!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_058="You did that? You bitch. You could have killed me with that fucking can. I almost got that freak, Samuel, fired!"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_060="You actually think you're better than me. No fucking way."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_063="No, bitch. You won't."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_065="Whoever makes that decision."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_067="Well, Max Caulfied, I could always choose to let you in the Vortex Club..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_069="Oh, you look so serious..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_071="I almost asked you to hang out. You said my photos were "Avedon-esque." Then I remembered who I was..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_075="Maybe we're too much alike..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_077="Well, Max Caulfield, there's still time for you to get in the Vortex Club..."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Phase01_Victoria_079="Why do you say it like that?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Quickphase_Victoria_001="Thanks, Max. I guess I'll be on my toes."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Quickphase_Victoria_002="Thanks for the drama, Max. Now go back where you belong."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_CHVictoria_Quickphase_Victoria_003="Just let me enjoy this party without you around."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_DontWarnVictoriaNice_RTC_Max_010="Oh, um... no reason. I'm glad we finally had a talk, Victoria. I see where you're coming from now."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_DontWarnVictoriaNice_RTC_Max_030="That's what they tell us... Speaking of, have you seen Nathan?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_DontWarnVictoriaNice_RTC_Max_050="Oh, Principal Wells wanted to see us Monday. No big deal."
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_DontWarnVictoriaNice_RTC_Max_070="Au revoir…"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_DontWarnVictoriaNice_RTC_Victoria_020="I don't blame you for not caring. I totally know I'm a mean bitch... Too much residue from my other school cliques. We are supposed to be adults, right?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_DontWarnVictoriaNice_RTC_Victoria_040="Nathan Prescott? Why do you want to know that?"
Cue_E4_8B_VIP_DontWarnVictoriaNice_RTC_Victoria_060="I hope he doesn't give you any shit. Actually, I haven't seen Nathan tonight. I swear."

Chara_FrankBowers_A="I'll never forget Frank—if only because he's the first and last person I will ever aim a gun at. How did Chloe end up in this sketchy drug dealer's orbit? The weird thing is that when I first saw him threatening Chloe in the junkyard, I was more shocked how un-creepy he looked. I expected some try-hard gangster, but he looked more like a dumpster diving troll. Which I guess he kinda is since we were on his turf, testing out my rewind skills for Chloe's amusement."

I expected some try-hard gangster, but he looked more like a dumpster diving troll. Which I guess he kinda is since we were on his turf, testing out my rewind skills for Chloe's amusement."
Chara_Joyce_A="Talking to Joyce Price after five years was almost as intense as seeing Chloe again. Especially right back in "ye olde" Two Whales Diner. That clinking of silverware and the smell of sizzling bacon rewound me back to being a kid, hanging out there with my parents for breakfast. I remember her always smiling at Chloe, even in mischief. Doubt she smiles at her hijinks now, but they still banter like mother and daughter."
Chara_Joyce_B="I moved to Seattle so soon after William died that I never saw how it affected Joyce. I'm glad she's not pissed at me for being selfish and never looking back. I still remember the last time Chloe and I saw him alive. I wonder how often Joyce relives that day? That's the worst kind of rewind: one you can't control. But if I could go back to that moment... what would I do?"
Chara_Joyce_C="I can only imagine how Joyce ended up with David Madsen. Talk about opposites. You can tell she loves him—disturbing as that sounds. Maybe she just wanted a more structured life for herself... Obviously it didn't work out that way with Chloe. I hope they both treat her right. Joyce deserves the best."
E4_Page00_A="October 10"
E4_Page00_Alt01="September 4, 2013\nSo much to do... I wish I could slow down time, especially to register all the cool things that have happened since I'm back in Arcadia. \n     Blackwell RULES!"
E4_Page00_Alt02="September 21\nYes, I'm older and thanks to Vic and Nathan I'm now a bit more fashionable too. They surprised me with the most beautiful straw pork pie hat, wrapped up furoshiki-style. Best birthday party ever. Also, drunkest. I can't sleep."
E4_Page00_Alt03="October 4\nHey dear Diary, remember me? Busy Max. Busy. Busy. Can’t write now. Must shoot. Must live. Must befriend. Should rekindle with Chloe too. "
E4_Page00_Alt04="But must Vortex first. \nParty time!!!!!!"
E4_Page00_B="Dear Diary."
E4_Page00_C="Let's never do the time warp again. I can't even begin to explain what happened. If I think too hard about the ramifications, my brain might melt. When I try to describe it, it's as if I'm describing something that happened to someone else."
E4_Page00_D="Chloe was so upset when we discovered that Rachel had actually been involved with Frank Bowers and she just blew up. I can never talk to her when she's like this and I just get so tired of having to walk on eggshells around her emotions. She still blames William for her messed up life, no matter how much she knows she's being unfair. I can't say that I wouldn't be just as messed up. Not that I'm not in my own way."
E4_Page00_E="In my room, all I could think was "I wish I could go back in time and help Chloe", and suddenly I was looking at the photograph William had taken of us on the day he died... and it started pulsing like it was 3D, like I could see INSIDE the photograph."
E4_Page00_F="Then I found myself actually back in the photo... to when I was 13 years old. I was back in Chloe's kitchen in the year 2008."
E4_Page01_A="With Chloe. And William."
E4_Page01_B="Right before he left to pick up Joyce for the last time. Since my powers somehow morphed to this new level of rewind, I decided that there was no way I was going to let William die again. So I played "hide the keys" until he had no other option but to take the bus."
E4_Page01_C="I was so happy I actually saved William. I never thought about what could go wrong..."
E4_Page01_D="I knew I was screwed when I came out of my epic rewind and saw Victoria Chase... but now she was my FRIEND. And I was a MEMBER of the Vortex Club. 'Nuff said."
E4_Page01_E="I knew I had screwed up. And then I felt sick thinking about what might have changed with Chloe... I had a clue when I saw David Madsen driving the school bus. He sure didn’t look so threatening anymore... I didn’t want to know how he ended up as a bus driver instead of with Joyce..."
E4_Page01_F="I felt my heart drop when I rushed to Chloe's house. So when William opened the door, I prepared myself for the worst..."
E4_Page01_G="That's when Chloe rolled forward in her wheelchair. Paralyzed from the neck down. I didn't even know what to say, so I covered my mouth in my typical gesture of shock and stupid. But Chloe's smile was so genuine and beautiful I almost cried."
E4_Page02_A="I had to adjust to everything without freaking out or telling Chloe that I actually altered time and space to save her father, but get her in a car accident so she can never walk again. The thing is, she was still Chloe. Just minus all the rage. This Chloe was just grateful to be alive and have her family watching over her."
E4_Page02_B="Chloe begged me to spend the night and, of course, I did. I noticed how run-down parts of their home were, compared to before. I saw the incredible expensive equipment that Chloe now requires, including her new garage room. Sorry, David."
E4_Page02_C="Even though I felt awful and disconnected, Chloe was just so bubbly and excited to hang out with me again, especially since I flaked on her pretty hardcore after her accident. Even in an alternate universe, I’m a shitty friend."
E4_Page02_D="Chloe's world was so new and unique to me, especially her strength and kindness... and pain. She needed a whole pharmacy to get through the day. I didn't feel sorry for her—I felt in awe with her attitude. This Chloe didn't blame anybody for her condition, even though she had the right. We strolled down the beach and saw the beached whales that proved something bad was happening in both realities..."
E4_Page03_A="And then Chloe asked me to put her to sleep."
E4_Page03_B="The accident left her body pretty much broken. Her lungs stopped working properly and she was basically dying a slow, painful death. She also felt so guilty about her parents' sacrifice and dwindling income. She wasn't erratic or tortured about this request, just... practical. Which made me feel even more terrible for putting her in this situation."
E4_Page03_C_DontKillChloe="But there was no way I was going to help my best friend take her own life. I couldn’t do it, especially after what happened with Kate. I know I should have done whatever Chloe asked of me, considering I was responsible for her situation. But how could I inject her full of morphine and just watch her fade away? I know she was upset, but I just had to tell myself that this reality wasn't... real."
E4_Page03_C_KillChloe="I agreed to help her, simply because she explained that she wanted to have a choice for the last time in her life... How could I argue with that? Especially since I knew I screwed up the entire universe by making a "simple" decision. And I knew I would have to go back eventually and accept the timeline that actually happened... So Chloe and I had one last movie night watching "Blade Runner", falling asleep to the sounds of Vangelis, and when I woke up, I put my best friend to sleep... forever."
E4_Page03_D="After my visit to Chloe's new world, I knew it was time to go Max To The Future. I had seen the result of my temporal tampering and I got scared thinking my new power wouldn't even work anymore. That would've been Cruel Karma. Fortunately, I was able to project myself into the photograph once again and I undid everything I had done..."
E4_Page03_E="Goodbye, William. Again."
E4_Page03_F="Hello, David. Again."
E4_Page04_A_KissChloe="I've never been so glad to see Chloe in my life. The second I saw her blue hair and that beautiful pissed off face I wanted to kiss her again."
E4_Page04_A_NoKissChloe="I've never been so glad to see Chloe in my life. The second I saw her blue hair and that beautiful pissed off face, I kind of regretted not kissing her when she double dared me. Maybe if she had double dog dared me..."
E4_Page04_B="And I couldn't even tell her where I had been... or why. It would be one more thing to alienate Chloe from me and the world. I had to get refocused on our search for Rachel. Chloe had been busy with her detective work, while I was in my alternate timeline."
E4_Page04_C_DefendDavid="Of course, she was already upset I'd defended David, even though I still didn't like any of his surveillance bullshit. But it seems like he's trying to help, even though I'm not really sure how. And I have to acknowledge that I simply don't know what the hell he's up to. Not that it stopped me from busting out some of my patented ninja moves so I could get around him to grab some more of his secret X-files..."
E4_Page04_C_DontDefendDavid="Of course, it was much easier for me to explore David's garage, since Joyce booted his ass out. That made Chloe more content than I've just about seen her since I returned. I still feel kinda bad for David, but he overstepped his authority. Dismissed. And it's so much easier to grab David's X-files when he's not there!"
E4_Page04_D="After we gathered our new info like Halloween treats, I loved watching Chloe go into "Sherlock" mode while we examined all of our clues on our big ol' drawing board. Of course, we all know that she's more of a Dr. Watson, right? Elementary!"
E4_Page04_E="Honestly, with all of the impending doom and sadness, I felt so... happy. Just to find myself back in action with my best friend and her butterfly blue hair."
E4_Page04_F="Hella yes."
E4_Page05_A="But first things first. I really had to go and see Kate. I've never visited anybody in the hospital before, much less anybody who's tried to commit suicide, so I was happy Chloe wanted to come along for support. The antiseptic smell and the endless white halls always kind of weird me out. Or maybe I'm just projecting my own fear of mortality."
E4_Page05_B="When I saw Kate in her room (surrounded by cards, flowers, and balloons), all I could think of was when I saw her the last time... on the roof. Her face was so sad and sincere and helpless then... but now she had more life in her than I'd seen in a long time."
E4_Page05_B2="I had no idea what to say to somebody in a situation like this ("How are you, after you almost jumped off a roof?"), but Kate's gentle spirit made it easy. I was overjoyed to see that she was drawing again and making plans for the future. Including plans to get justice for what Nathan Prescott had done to her."
E4_Page05_C="Or what I call REVENGE."
E4_Page05_D="So after getting the inside info and assist from the other members of our team, Chloe and I made our way to the boys' dorm a.k.a. "Nathan's Lair." Chloe stood guard out in the hall and I stealthed my way into Nathan's room."
E4_Page05_E="And even though I've become a master spy and detective, I still get surprised by things I see or find... like Nathan's sleek, expressionist bro cave. It was like walking from light to shadow in a single step. I swear, I could feel the temperature drop the second I walked in. But then, Nathan knows photography and he knows you have to keep the film and equipment chilled (I store my instant film hoard in Mr. Jefferson's classroom)."
E4_Page06_A="Speaking of cold stuff, Nathan's room was layered in creepy shit. The disturbing but impressive photos, all the evidence from his father's bullying, and probably the most important clue we could ever find: Nathan's phone, likely loaded with messages and mysteries. It's not a good thing that I've internalized spying and stealing so casually over the past week... Everyday Hero, amirite?"
E4_Page06_B="And that’s when Nathan Prescott showed up. He looked so wild-eyed and out of control that I felt a twinge of sympathy that he clearly needed help. But then I remembered he was also an asshole and had been extremely dangerous to me, Chloe and Kate. So before I had to rewind, Warren entered the scene and my White Knight HEADBUTTED Nathan in perfect payback. I couldn’t believe it. Neither could Nathan."
E4_Page06_C_BeatNathan="In fact, Warren literally did GO APE all over Nathan's face. It wasn't cool, but my nerves were so frayed from the week and I was so over all the Blackwell bullies that I didn't try to stop Warren from beating Nathan into submission. Warren had his own issues to work out on Nathan."
E4_Page06_C_DontBeatNathan="In fact, Warren literally started to GO APE all over Nathan's face. It wasn't cool, but my nerves were so frayed from the week and I was so over all the Blackwell bullies that I almost didn't want to stop Warren from beating Nathan into the floor. Warren has his own issues to work out with Nathan, but this wasn't the time or place. Even if Nathan deserved it and I would've been happy to watch Warren show him who was a Blackwell boss now."
E4_Page07_A_FrankDead="After that dorm brawl, Chloe and I headed to the beach to deal with Frank and see if we could get him to join us. I had to be careful and not get him more agro. \n\nHe was pissed that we snuck into his RV and "borrowed" his account book.  The more I tried to reason with Frank, he went from zero to knife. All I could think was, "This is really happening. I’m outside an RV in a gun fight with a drug dealer." And Chloe shot him in self-defense. Frank Bowers is dead. We saw him die in front of us. I didn’t even know what to think or how....I didn’t even rewind...I know Chloe was in as much shock as me. It was so surreal looking down at Frank’s body\nnext to the ocean where we had played as kids....So our mission to bring Frank onboard ended in his death. Now we’re in bigger trouble – legal trouble. I know Chloe shot him to save me so it was self-defense, but if we didn’t come down here he would still be alive. \n\nThis is not how I wanted our visit to go. And I don’t want Chloe to torture herself even more over what happened. No matter what, she did save my life. \n\nBut I’m still responsible for taking a life. What the hell are we doing?"

E4_Page07_A_FrankDead_D="But I'm still responsible for taking a life. What the hell are we doing?"
E4_Page07_A_FrankFoe="After that dorm brawl, Chloe and I headed to the beach to deal with Frank and see if we could get him to join us. Unfortunately, Frank was not in a helping mood. And he went ballistic and attacked Chloe. She injured him in the leg which totally freaked me out even though I feel like I’ve been seeing Chloe get shot all week. All I could think was, "This is really happening. I’m outside an RV in a fight with a drug dealer."  So our mission to bring Frank onboard was impossible. Now he’s even more pissed off at Chloe – and me. Part of me thinks he has the right since we wounded him in the leg, but the other part thinks that Frank would be hurt at some point by somebody else. He should be lucky it was by us dorks. I hope his leg is okay and we don’t end up with worse karma. This is not how I wanted our visit to go. And I don’t want Chloe to beat herself even more over what happened. She did defend me. Sigh. But we do have bigger Franks to fry. Or fuck up. Onward."

E4_Page07_A_FrankFriend="After that dorm brawl, Chloe and I headed to the beach to deal with Frank and see if we could get him to join us. I had to be careful and not get him all tweaked out. He was pretty pissed that we got into his RV and "borrowed" his account book but once he saw that we didn’t care about drugs or money only Rachel, he mellowed out. \n\nAll I could think was, "I’m trying to get a drug dealer to help me find a missing girl."  Incredibly, Frank actually agreed to help! He knows how naïve and clueless we are so I hope that our sincerity swayed him. I’m still sketchy about him and I can’t be so naïve that I don’t keep my rewind guard up. I don’t know much about him except he sells drugs, has a wicked temper, and he loved Rachel. Even more than his beans. So we get to add another member to our team...BOO YAH!"

E4_Page07_A_FrankFriend_D="So, we get to add another member to our team... BOOYAH!"
E4_Page08_A="My life feels so surreal at this point, I don't know how to react anymore. I can rewind time and space, but is it aging me before my own time and space? Am I learning things I shouldn't, messing up too much shit... including my own history? Obviously, my nosebleeds and dizzy spells are a bad sign that I'm overusing my powers, but it's become almost part of my nature... or maybe a habit. Power corrupts? Not yet. I hope."
E4_Page08_B="I remember this famous episode of the original Star Trek, where Kirk has to go back in time and let the person he loves die, so the Nazis won't win the war... What kind of fucked up choice is that? What would have happened if I had not been in the school bathroom to save Chloe that day?"
E4_Page08_C="But dammit, I was there and thus I was supposed to be there. DESTINY."
E4_Page08_D_FrankDead="So now that we are responsible for ending Frank’s life, even if it was in self-defense, was he meant to die that way? Crumpled up in his own blood on the dirty ground? \n\nI don’t know how  much more death and violence I can take this week… But I know there’s something bigger going on than poor Frank or poor me...Maybe a storm that will destroy Arcadia Bay...and what else?\n\nI couldn’t explain this to Chloe though. She’s devastated about Frank and I can’t blame her. ShBut she can’t give up now. Chloe is a genuine bad-ass but she doesn’t have the luxury of my powers so she has to trust me that this is our destiny. Right? So I can’t be any kind of hero without my faithful companion...and Chloe has to know that she might play the biggest role in all of this apocalyptic bullshit. \n\nAnd now we have Nathan’s phone, David’s coordinates, Frank’s account book and a big board of clues, which brings us closer to finding Rachel Amber.  \n\nFinally."

E4_Page08_D_FrankFoe_A="So things got a bit out of hand with Frank, but honestly, what else could we expect? He’s not really your everyday hero type, and it was probably stupid of us to hope for a change, but hey, we had to confront him. We tried to persuade him we’re on the same side, but it was a waste of time."
E4_Page08_D_FrankFoe_B="We eventually had to defend ourselves and hurt him in the leg, but despite the rage in his eyes he somehow gave us what we were looking for. He was on the verge of unleashing hell on us, but I think we've avoided the worst. I just hope our paths won't cross again anytime soon."
E4_Page08_D_FrankFoe_C="I still don't know why Chloe or even Rachel would want to hang out with Frank, but I can't suss that out anymore. Maybe if I hadn't left town I'd be less judgmental, but I definitely don't see the good in him... Anyhow, we tried, right? And now we have Nathan's phone, David's coordinates, Frank's account book, and a big board of clues, which brings us closer to finding Rachel Amber. Finally. "
E4_Page08_D_FrankFriend="And the fact that we were able to convince Frank to actually help us gives the most hope I’ve had in awhile. \n\nYes, Chloe and I were stupid to confront Frank like that considering how he reacted before, but I don’t see how anybody can’t say he didn’t really love Rachel Amber. He shouldn’t have pulled a knife on Chloe though, and I don’t like that he sells all these dangerous meds to teenagers, especially Nathan. He needs psychiatric supervision not just baggies of pills. At least he won’t be going to Frank again. I still don’t know why Chloe or even Rachel would want to hang out with Frank but I can’t suss that out anymore. Maybe if I hadn’t left town I’d be less judgemental… But now we have Nathan’s phone, David’s coordinates, Frank’s account book, and a big board of clues, which brings us closer to finding Rachel Amber. Finally.\n\nSo maybe the tide is finally turning...or the time is finally turning...."

So maybe the tide is finally turning... or time is finally turning..."
E4_Page09_A="This is the moment where all the clues come together and we finally have a location outside of town that may lead us straight to Rachel Amber... and beyond."
E4_Page09_B_FrankDead="After everything that happened with Frank, I had to convince Chloe to keep going forward with me, since I do feel we're at the end of the road... hopefully not the end of the world. But whatever anger Chloe has inside her that makes her so self-destructive is matched by her balls and bravery. Yes, Chloe has gotten me nearly killed, but I know she would die for me. And I can't forget I put her in a wheelchair to slowly die in another reality... "
E4_Page09_C="And Chloe is more focused now than before. I told her we have to keep moving forward no matter what and I couldn’t find Rachel on my own. That was enough.\n\nNow it’s time to shine a light into the Dark Room..."
E4_Page10_A="Chloe and I loaded up our coordinates and hit the road. We were both quiet, yet excited... it's hard to explain the feeling. Even with all the horrible things happening, I found myself thinking that Chloe and I were part of some greater mystery that involved time, space, and all our fates. I've never had much faith, not the Kate Marsh kind anyway, but I couldn't believe we were being set up for doom after everything that's happened this week."
E4_Page10_B="But I wasn’t prepared for the Dark Room. \n\nThe coordinates led us to an old "abandoned" farm owned by the Prescott family and I shouldn’t have been surprised that it was actually housing a weird secure bunker that was filled with Prescott memorabilia... and worse."
E4_Page10_C="If there was evil ground zero, this place was it. Cupboards filled with named red binders that confirmed our worst nightmares... not that I even had any clue that our amateur detective work would lead us to this kind of professional hell. When I saw the binder marked "Victoria," my heart started pounding like a jackhammer. Then I had a real clue about what was coming..."
E4_Page10_D="I don’t even want to think about the images we saw of Kate Marsh posed unconscious with that motherfucker, Nathan Prescott. She did know the truth about what happened to her even if she couldn’t remember all the awful details… And then Rachel Amber. Delicately composed photographs of her drugged and all over Nathan like some kind of sick goth couple. I couldn’t bear to look at Chloe’s face as she looked at the photos of her abused angel. I felt nauseated. All the hope I was feeding Chloe felt like vapor. And then we saw exactly where Nathan had taken his vicious layout with poor Rachel. In the junkyard."
E4_Page11_A="We finally found Rachel Amber. Dead and buried. \nI'm sorry, Rachel. I'm sorry, Chloe. I'm sorry, Kate. I'm sorry, William."
E4_Page11_B="FUCK YOU, ARCADIA BAY."
E4_Page11_C=""High school should be the best years of your life," I've heard over and over from my parents and other experts. Fuck do they know? Tell that to Rachel Amber. Or Kate.\nI've never seen Chloe so cold and hard. She won't let go of the gun.\nSo we have to find Nathan before Chloe kills him. And if that happens, it will be hard to rewind."
E4_Page11_D="But we’re as close to the end of this nightmare as possible, so I have to block out those images of Kate Marsh and Rachel Amber that will be burned into my retinas forever. There’s still a final secret to uncover and nothing is going to stop us now. Not even a goddamn tornado."
E4_Page11_E="Chloe and I pulled up to Blackwell's parking lot and arrived at the "End Of The World" party. Oh, the irony! We had to get rid of poor Warren fast, who wanted to bask in his alpha glory and hang out with Chloe and me. I can't put another one of my friends in danger. So bizarro to see all the students dressed up in expensive outfits or pre-Halloween costumes, talking and laughing and smoking and drinking, as if there wasn’t a serial killer going to the same party, or the town wasn't in eco-danger..."
E4_Page12_A="As if to remind me of Arcadia Bay’s ticking doomsday clock, I actually saw two moons in the sky over the horizon... or that’s what it looked like briefly before the clouds rolled over. I squinted and actually rubbed my eyes like a dork just to make sure my iris wasn’t foggy. Was this another sign or an environmental illusion? Other people saw it too... Except, Chloe didn’t see anything — besides vengeance. So she went into the gym looking for Nathan before I could catch up. \nNathan doesn’t know that he’s running out of time too. No irony intended. We are."
E4_Page12_B="My first and last Vortex Club party. Flashing lights and DJ Doom (no comment) spinning. In an alternate reality, I might have been at this party, standing in the corner shy and nervous, waiting for somebody to ask me to dance but being terrified if that happened... And that would have been the limits of my problems. Now look at me.\nBut I had to find Chloe first, then Nathan before she shot him."
E4_Page12_C_DontTellVictoria="No matter how evil I thought Victoria was, she's actually just a terribly insecure person with talent, passion, and a tendency to be a cruel dick for no good reason. But that doesn't mean she'll step outside herself to look at me without her hate. I tried to see beyond our petty mean girl drama, assuming she has some role to play in all of this, but she made it impossible and I had to find Chloe. I felt shitty not warning her, but I just have to hope that Victoria is the one person Nathan would leave alone, if only out of friendship or the fact that assholes stick together."
E4_Page12_C_TellVictoria="No matter how evil I thought Victoria was, she's actually just a terribly insecure person with talent, passion, and a tendency to be a cruel dick for no good reason. I have to see beyond our petty mean girl drama and assume she has a role to play in all of this too. So we talked like human beings and I warned her, without specifics about Nathan. She believed me and it felt so warm to make a connection with my previous "enemy." A sliver of light in all this darkness. Let there be more."
E4_Page12_C_TellVictoria_Foe="No matter how evil I thought Victoria was, she's actually just a terribly insecure person with talent, passion, and a tendency to be a cruel dick for no good reason. But that doesn't mean she'll step outside herself to look at me without her hate.

So I just warned her and left, hoping the actual human being deep inside her got the information and considered taking it seriously. Fair enough?"

E4_2D_Garage_E4Drawer05_SP02="Blackwell Academy, the 8th of August, 2011\nDear Mr. and Mrs. Price,\n\nAs Principal, I am in sympathy with your numerous requests for Chloe’s special needs in regards to her wheelchair and class accessibility, etc. Blackwell prides itself on making sure students with disabilities receive full compliance under the Americans With Disabilities Act. However, given that the campus and buildings have all been constructed pre-1977, our school has not yet undergone the modern renovations necessary to fulfill all the needs of your daughter and her regrettable condition. Sadly, with recent deplorable federal cuts in education, it will take many more fundraisers to fully update Blackwell Academy. But that day will come!\n\nChloe is without doubt an amazing student with great potential despite her handicap and I believe she would find a more fitting, rewarding scholastic environment at the H. West Miskatonic Institute in Bolton. They have a rich legacy of disabled graduates and I know that Chloe would achieve her usual academic leadership in more comfortable surroundings. With her outstanding GPA, there is no doubt that Miskatonic would welcome Chloe with open halls.\n\nI hope you will seriously consider this suggestion as I’m sure your daughter would prefer to attend a school that can cater to her many needs. In the same spirit, I’ve also enclosed brochures for other potential schools in the Oregon region. If you have any questions, please contact my office.\n\nSincerely,\nPrincipal Wells"

E4_3A_ChloeRoom_MagazineClipping_SP01="The Great Northwest \n\n"The Prescotts' Pan Estates: Haven or Hell?"\nBy Craig Kennedy\n\nThe name "Prescott" may not mean much to you or to those outside the edges of a small coastal Oregon town, but this is a name that means quite a bit in Arcadia Bay, a quaint town seemingly stuck in time. Once home to a prosperous fishing and tourism industry, the town has seen much better pay days, despite the local success of the prestigious Blackwell Academy and its football and swimming teams, the Bigfoots and the Otters. Environmental changes to the area have reduced the amount of fish and other sea life, resulting in a stagnant economy and limited tourism. Oddly, the Prescotts have managed to keep their business interests quite profitable—in fact, they're behind an expensive, exclusive housing development known as "Pan Estates," to be built into the deep forests near Blackwell Academy. Local Native American groups have already filed various motions against the development, citing widespread destruction of tribal lands and natural resources. \n\nContinued on Next Page"

E4_5A_NathanRoom_JeffersonLetter_SP01="Dear Mr. Prescott,\n\nAs a photography teacher at Blackwell Academy, it’s my privilege to meet many talented and ambitious students who I believe will all reach their goals in one way or another. This is a realistic view of today’s highly limited and competitive art market -- and a pragmatic POV I stress in my lectures. I can say with as much validity as my awards and experience are worth to you, that Nathan Prescott has one of the finest eyes for photography I’ve ever encountered at Blackwell. Talent without passion or commitment can be a great hobby, but not a career. To be blunt, Nathan has been very lax this semester about turning in his assignments and his erratic behavior in class has been noted by faculty and students. \n\nEven though Nathan is a legal adult, I feel that as his father and Blackwell benefactor, you know your son better than anybody here and would appreciate the spirit of my concern for his well-being. On the academic side, Nathan must turn in all of his remaining assignments for his portfolio within two weeks in order to pass the class  and retain his excellent GPA.  \n\nThank you for your time and I’m always available to talk if you have any questions. \n\nBest, \nMark Jefferson"

Cue_E5_1A_DarkRoom_VictoriaAwake_Max_040="You’ve been drugged like Kate... and me. Do you remember how you got here?"
Cue_E5_1A_DarkRoom_VictoriaAwake_Max_080="Listen carefully. Mark Jefferson kidnapped us. He’s using Nathan, as well. Jefferson is very dangerous, so we have to get out of here before he comes back."
Cue_E5_1A_DarkRoom_VictoriaAwake_Victoria_030="Max... Oh God, where... where are we? What’s happening?"
Cue_E5_1A_DarkRoom_VictoriaAwake_Victoria_050="No... I don’t know... Wait... You warned me. You warned me about Nathan. Then I went to Jefferson for help, and he was acting so weird... That’s the last thing I remember. And I can’t move my hands! Help me, Max! Please, I’m sorry for everything."

Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion2_Jefferson_060="You're trying too hard. I know you're scared... You all... have the same doe-eyed look when you wake up here... replaced by fear as you realize what's about to happen."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion2_Jefferson_080="That’s a wrap. In the 90’s, we would celebrate a magazine session with Cristal and cocaine... now it’s kombucha and vitamin C... Shit, there are barely magazines anymore... I miss the 90’s... That was my time... my moment..."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion2_Jefferson_100="Oh, Max... I'm so glad you asked that question.|Simply put, I'm obsessed with the idea of capturing that moment innocence evolves into corruption.|That shift from black to white to gray... and beyond."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion2_Jefferson_110="Most models are cynical. They lose that naiveté.|However, some Blackwell students carry their hope and... optimism with them like... an aura.|And those lucky few become my models... my subjects."

Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion2_Jefferson_170="It meant a lot to me that you were here, Max... and that the last image you’ll ever see is actually your own through my vision... Now that is a gift…"

Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion2_Max_090="Mr. Jefferson, why are you doing this?"
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion2_Max_130="Yes, you're a psychopath.|And this is your last session."

Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_030="I knew you were special the second I saw your first "selfie." Yes, I still hate that word."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_040="But I love the purity of your own image. Not like Rachel, who was always looking in the wrong places. Poor Rachel. Wait... Let me try this angle."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_050="Don’t move!"
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_060="Oh, much... better. Thanks, Max.|If only Nathan could see this setup.|He tried so hard, but you can't just throw a few subjects around and|expect a cohesive style or theme."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_070="But he had an eye for shadows. And an eye for a whole lot more, as his elite family will find out... along with Arcadia Bay."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_080="Nice... Good...|Oh, those eyes..."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_090="So wise yet so innocent…"
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_100="It's just too bad you're so goddamn nosy, Max!|But this room... is under 24/7 surveillance,|so all I had to do was text you from Nathan's phone,|and you fell right into my hands."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_110="You really should have focused on schoolwork, not "private detecting" with your little friend."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_130="Chloe, right.|Yeah, I'm sorry that I killed—that Nathan killed her in self-defense.|But she had a troubled history like most Arcadia Bay drop-outs.|Nobody will be surprised, or care."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_140="Though I promise... people will care when you die tonight, Max. I wasn't lying when I said you have a gift."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_145="There’s a reason I came to this hick tourist trap town. To find perfect innocence... like you."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_150="Okay. Now this looks good.|Maybe a few more close-ups..."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_160="Max, please do not move so much. I need you posed and framed my way!"
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_165="Maybe a new dose will calm you down…"
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_170="Now don’t move, or this will... hurt... much."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_180="Stupid bitch!!!"
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_190="You just don't listen, do you? In fact, you never did hear much in my class... If you had, you might have seen all this coming."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_200="But you couldn’t even save poor Kate Marsh... Could you?"
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_210="Like you were able to save Kate Marsh... Somehow…"
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_220="Aw, those chemicals are hard to get and expensive, Max... I don’t have a trust fund and Blackwell doesn’t pay shit. That was Nathan’s role…"
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_230="Goddamn, you are a fighter, though. I've had my eye on you, and I've noticed that you've been more... fearless this week than maybe your whole life."
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_240="Like you, Max, I am a camera. And like some cultures believe, I’m going to use my camera to capture your soul. Forever... Now take a break, our session is just getting started…"
Cue_E5_1B_DarkRoom_Insertion_Jefferson_245="Like you, Max, I am a camera. And like some cultures believe, I’m going to use my camera to capture your soul. Now take a break, I need to deal with Nathan first. Don’t worry, our session is just getting started…"

Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_005="And don't get me started on your late partner... I had enough of those faux-punk sluts in my Seattle days."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_006="Unlike pure, sweet Kate Marsh, I don't believe in that bullshit. She could have been my masterpiece. The world is what an artist makes it... and my muse—"
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_007="She had a loaded weapon. This was clearly self-defense.|But that's what happens when you play with guns... or try to fuck with me.|It's better when they don't know... like pure, sweet Kate."

Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_015="When you told the principal that I made Kate cry, I thought you almost had me. It's good our esteemed Principal Wells is like most administrators... a closet drunk."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_016="Too bad you already made a convincing argument against Nathan in the Principal's office. Thank you so much, for setting him up for me."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_017="Then why did you blame David Madsen for stalking Kate? Of course, he was the only person who was about to find out the truth. |Irony..."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_018="I do know that the Prescotts are going to have a major scandal when the town finds out what their elite son has been doing for homework..."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_021="I prefer the term "manipulated." Like with an image... Nathan's was easy to twist around."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_022="Don't judge people, Max. But that's why Nathan never should have been at Blackwell..."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_025="You're wrong again. He was genuinely talented. And his father is a serious asshole, as you might know."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_026="I helped Nathan realize his vision... So few people get that chance."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_029="I became a sort of father figure for Nathan. It happens often in teacher/student relationships. It was kind of touching for a while."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_031="Don't be stupid, Max. I told him what he needed to hear. In return, I had access to the Prescott fortune. Who do you think paid for this glorious dark room and equipment? How else could I get all these hip new drugs for my subjects?"

Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_040="I'm sorry, Max. That was not cool."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_044="Let's be honest, she was doing the classic "bad boy" thing. She was over Frank before it began. He just didn't know."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_045="Rachel was in love with me.|That's not my ego. Just look at our sessions.|Not that I'll let you.|Nobody loved having their picture taken more."

Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_052="No! You didn't. It's just too bad that he fell in lust with Rachel. He actually thought he could mimic what I do with a camera and subject. Like father, but not like son..."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_054="Dead and buried.|After what he did to Rachel, I knew I couldn't keep him as a protégé for much longer.|Now the police will never find his body...|Do you finally get it now, Max? I can't compromise my vision with amateurs."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_056="I do love your spirit, Max, but you brought yourself here, by your own choice.|Anyway, I like my models to be seen and not heard… so I have to make sure—|there's nothing left behind of you."
Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_058="Right. Thanks for reminding me... There's nothing more innocent than a teenager's diary... Oh look, here's the last selfie you took in my class... Never listening, as always..."

Cue_E5_1C_DarkRoom_CHJefferson_Phase01_Max_010="Artists don't drive teenagers to suicide for any bullshit muse. You trained Nathan to drug Kate... to take photos of her. That's why she's dead."

Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_CHJefferson_Phase01_Jefferson_018="Now Max, since you've captured our interest and clearly want to join the conversation, can you please tell us the name of the process that gave birth to the first self-portraits?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_CHJefferson_Phase01_Max_002="The Daguerreian Process."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_CHJefferson_Phase01_Max_004="The Daguerreian Process. He was a real visionary... not a hypocrite."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_CHJefferson_Phase01_Max_005="I'm not into "capturing" your interest. That's kind of sick, isn't it?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_CHJefferson_Phase01_Max_006="Who cares? This class is hella bullshit."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_CHJefferson_Phase01_Max_010="Was it? Okay."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_CHJefferson_Phase01_Max_011="I mean that he actually created something. He didn't just take pictures of models and pretend they were art."

Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_CHJefferson_Phase01_Max_013="Sorry, there's no time left. I mean, your class is almost over."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_DiscussionLoop_Jefferson_010="Yes Victoria, you still have to do your homework this week, even if you're submitting your photo for the competition. Everybody in class is turning in a photo, so you see the dilemma."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_DiscussionLoop_Jefferson_030="You have just by participating, by putting yourself out there in the world. Well, no matter who wins, this is just a bump on a bigger road. I don't want anybody to feel excluded from this process. But I also want everybody to know that this photographic world is not for everybody. I had my moment in the camera eye and everybody should have that chance, right?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_DiscussionLoop_Victoria_020="I know Mr. Jefferson. I just worked so hard on this shot, and I'm sure you know what it's like to be consumed by your work. I just really think "Everyday Heroes" is an important cultural event and I want to represent Blackwell Academy."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_DiscussionLoop_Victoria_040="Oh totally. I only want to share whatever gifts I have with the world..."

Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Jefferson_120="I think I should stay out of this one, Victoria."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Jefferson_150="That was kind of random, Max. What did you mean?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Max_010="Mr. Jefferson? We need to talk."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Max_040="Yes, I see. But maybe you shouldn’t..."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Max_070="I will be when Victoria understands that hiding behind a screen, posting videos of people is incredibly cruel and unfair. You’re smart enough to know how easy it is to hurt somebody, to destroy their life."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Max_080="I just want you to think about how much it would hurt if somebody did that to you. You can make always the right choice, Victoria. I know you’ve got a good heart. I’ve seen it."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Max_100="You don’t have to explain. There’s no reason for you to be so insecure that you can’t be happy with your own talent. Wouldn’t it be better to lift people up than to bring them down? You could inspire people..."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Max_140="And that’s okay too."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Victoria_030="Can you see I’m talking to Mr. Jefferson now?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Victoria_050="Uh, and why not?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Victoria_090="Listen... I... I didn’t..."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Victoria_110="Okay, I don’t know what you’re talking about now... do I, Mr. Jefferson?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhotoNice_Victoria_130="Then I guess I’m done talking."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Jefferson_020="Uh..."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Jefferson_060="Hold on, Victoria. Are you okay, Max?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Jefferson_120="Well, it looks like you already did, Victoria..."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Jefferson_150="I'm not going to say I didn't enjoy that, but... why?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Jefferson_170="Oh... That was easy."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Jefferson_190="Well, I, uh...|I can't pre-judge yet, but I'm very happy you decided to enter.|That means a lot to me... and Blackwell.|The first step for any artist is to put themselves out there in the world without fear.|To be... innocent."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Jefferson_210="Uh, well...|Thanks for the photo, and maybe both of us will be jet-setting to San Francisco this Friday."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Jefferson_230="Don’t be so modest, Max. Anything can happen in a week..."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Max_010="Mr. Jefferson? We need to talk."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Max_040="I can see you're kissing ass again... Nothing new."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Max_070="Not until Victoria knows that hiding behind a screen and posting videos of people is totally fucked up."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Max_080="You know how easy it is to hurt somebody, to destroy their life? Are you proud of yourself? If you have any feelings left, you should think about your actions."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Max_100="Of course you did. You’re so insecure you can’t even be happy with your own talent. You have to try and bring everybody down to your mean and ugly level."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Max_140="I sure hope so."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Max_160="Here’s my photograph for the "Everyday Heroes" contest."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Max_180="No. It wasn't easy at all."

Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Victoria_050="What did you just say?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Victoria_090="Listen... I... I didn’t..."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Victoria_110="Okay, I do not have to listen to this bullshit... do I, Mr. Jefferson?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_GivePhoto_Victoria_130="Then I guess I’m done talking."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_JeffGivingLesson_Jefferson_050="I could frame any one of you in a dark corner,|and capture you in a moment of desperation."

Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_KateHug_Kate_040="I am."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_KateHug_Kate_060="Max... That makes me feel so blessed for the first time this week... I... I don’t know what to say..."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_KateHug_Kate_080="Thanks. You always know the right thing to do."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_KateHug_Max_010="Hi, Kate..."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_KateHug_Max_030="Kate, listen to me."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_KateHug_Max_050="Always remember that you're not alone. I've got your back, no matter what happens. So do a lot of other people. We all care, we’re all here for you. You need to know that."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_KateHug_Max_070="That's okay, neither do I. Maybe we could both use a hug."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_Polaroid_Picture01_Jefferson_010="Shh-shhh. I believe Max has taken what you kids call a "selfie."|A dumb word for a wonderful photographic tradition. And Max... has a gift."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_Polaroid_Picture01_Jefferson_020="Of course, as you all know, the photo portrait has been popular since the early 1800s. Your generation was not the first to use images for "selfie-expression."|Sorry. I couldn't resist.|The point remains that the portraiture has always been a vital aspect of art,|and photography, for as long as it's been around."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_Polaroid_Picture01_Jefferson_030="Now, Max, since you've captured our interest and clearly want to join the conversation, can you please tell us the name of the process that gave birth to the first self-portraits?"
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_TextMessage_Max_010="Time to change time."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_TextMessage_Max_015="Yes! I’m back. It worked."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_TextMessage_Max_020="Oh Kate..."
Cue_E5_2A_ArtClass_TextMessage_Max_030="You wanted me to enter the contest, asshole."

Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_043="Then it's Jefferson's turn to die now. I understand why you don't want to do this, and I won't blame you for not coming with me."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_044="Oh... Max. I'm... I'm so sorry...|I was the one who dragged you into all this shit...|Nobody, especially you, should have to go through that...|Now we have to stop Jefferson...|with one bullet."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_046="That's so easy for you to say. You don't know what my life has been these past five years."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_048="Max, I'm not running from you! This is when I need you the most. This is how to make everything up to me. With your power and my gun... nothing in the universe can stop us now, Max!"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_050="Wait... alternate realities?|What do you mean, Max? What did you do?"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_054="Then you can't be sure of anything! That's why I'm going to take out Jefferson... and that will be our reality."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_056="Max, what the hell are you talking about?"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_060="Of course I do. Do you think I would even know how to handle that situation?|Nobody would...|The important thing is that we're together again."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_062="I hear you, Max... but do you think we should let Jefferson get away with torture and murder?"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_064="Who owns the police here? And they'd probably put us in a fucking cell! Max, I know you're still in shock over what happened... but we have to face this reality... Let's go get him!"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_066="I'd like to think that and just take off with you right now.|But Max... I don't trust karma anymore. Rachel deserves justice.|Now. With our help..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_069="I don't get it... Why do you trust him, after you totally reamed him the other day? He's not even at our house anymore."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_070="Is that why you stuck up for him? Because you think he can help us? Really?"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_075="Yes, a slap across the face is a sure sign of tough love."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_076="Oh, please... like he cared when he got in your face for smoking a joint?"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_077="Oh please... like he cared when he busted into my room."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_078="Max... I had no clue... I should have been the one to save you, but... I'm so grateful David was there."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_079="Except that he was actually investigating everybody, Max... including your friend Kate.|Sorry, but I still don't trust him. It's up to us, Max."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_085="Are you serious? I can't see him showing any feeling... except towards my mom..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_086="So what's your plan?"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_090="One thing I learned at Blackwell is the saying,|"Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it..."|I have to do this... So I guess I'm on my own... again."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_091="Max. Please tell me... I won't be mad at you..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_093="You saw my dad again?"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_095="God, Max...|That must have been... That must have been awful for you...|I'm so sorry I had to ask you that..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Chloe_096="Okay. You've been through so much... I believe you, Max. After all, I'm still your faithful companion."

Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_019="Chloe, please, take my hand. I know this is hard. But it's harder for me to see you die again..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_020="You know, I've modified the past... William was alive but you... you... You asked me to kill you because you couldn't handle it anymore... Please Chloe... I want this timeline to be the one where I save you!"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_024="Rachel woudn't like you to die like that! Chloe I've seen you... If you go there, it's like your abandoning me... Please don't let me see this again!"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_025="Chloe, now is your time to think about the futur! Not the past! Try to move on, I beg you!"

Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_034="In a few minutes I won’t remember anything I just said to you, you’ll have to explain to me everything back, just tell me I traveled through time through a photo again and I’ll believe you"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_035="And this is important! Tell me not to tell anything to Victoria or she will warn Jefferson and get kidnapped too!"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_036="Chloe, you can't get revenge if you're dead!"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_039="Jefferson kidnapped Rachel and some other girls. He was also manipulating Nathan, and… he killed him."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_040="Chloe...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jefferson drugged and kidnapped me.|I was tied up in his bunker.|You have no idea what hell I went through to get back here… but I couldn't let you die. You brought me back here, and I can't lose you again. I won't!"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_041="Mark Jefferson turned out to be a psychopath..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_045="Chloe, I know this isn't easy, but it's time for you... and me... to let the past go. We have to focus on our future, while we still have one."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_047="Chloe! I should never have run away from you like I did when we left Arcadia Bay. I know I hurt you… All I ever wanted was to make it up to you. Please, don't run away from me…"

Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_051="Chloe, I'm...|I'm going to tell you the truth, no matter what.|I changed your past and I had to make a terrible choice, and I... I..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_052="I fucked up, Chloe. I wanted to make things right, but everything turned out wrong."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_053="Uh... nothing. I mean, whenever I use my rewind, I create new timelines, new destinies..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_055="No, no... Chloe, hold on!"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_057="And I did... for you. I didn't want you to suffer in any other timeline or reality... I couldn't bear the thought of you in any more pain..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_058="But Chloe, there was no way I could do that...|I had to return to this timeline... to see you again. I had to..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_059="It was worse for you.|But I had no idea what would happen, and... as usual,|I messed everything up, and… I never want to hurt you, ever.|You have to believe me."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_061="You're right. That's why you should come with me so we can stay together... and stay alive."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_063="No! We go to the police and let them take over. We have plenty of evidence."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_065="As long as you're alive, I don't care. Karma will catch up to him eventually."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_068="Of course not! If we tell David, he'll believe us and he can actually stop him... right?"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_071="Chloe, David saved me from Jefferson... If he didn't track down the Dark Room... I'd be dead right now."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_072="Chloe, no matter how much of a douche he's been, David truly cares about you."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_074="David was already investigating Jefferson. He was way ahead of us..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_080="I know he's been difficult, but... he's the only one who knows what's going on and he's the only one who can help us."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_082="No, no, listen to me... wait, Chloe!"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_083="You should have seen his reaction when I told him that Jefferson… killed you. He was crushed."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_084="You should have seen how relieved he was when I lied to him and told him you didn't die. It would have crushed him..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_087="We tell him everything, including that Victoria is in danger."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_088="Yes, you are. So listen: In a few minutes, I won't know any of this happened... Nothing. You have to tell me exactly what I did and said... Just explain that I travelled through time using the photo... We have to stay in your room and do nothing. Then we explain everything to David... and we finally let him do his job."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_089="Come on, of course I... but at some point you have to move forward..."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_092="I was able to go back in time... to the last day William was alive.|I stopped him from leaving, but...|But you ended up in a car crash instead."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_Max_094="You... you were completely paralyzed. And you were in pain. You were slowly dying, and you… you asked me to… end your life."

Cue_E5_6A_Parking_Insertion_Chloe_070="I'm glad you're with me, too. What's going on, Max? We have to find Nathan right now. He's going to fucking pay for what he did to Rachel... Let's go, now."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_Insertion_Chloe_100="I can walk and listen, okay?"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_Insertion_Chloe_120="Fine, Max. I'm listening."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_Insertion_Chloe_140="You used your powers, right? And you fucked around with time, and I died."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_Insertion_Chloe_160="You’re supposed to back me up. So there’s no way that punk-ass bitch Nathan Prescott is taking me down."
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_Insertion_Chloe_190="Jefferson, the art teacher? That's bullshit! Nathan is the fucking serial killer! We saw the proof!"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_Insertion_Chloe_195="Now, excuse me, I’m going to that party to make sure he never hurts anybody again. Are you coming?"
Cue_E5_6A_Parking_Insertion_Max_020="Chloe!"

Cue_E5_6A_Parking_Insertion_Max_170="You're right, he won't."

And there was honesty about the economic conditions of the era, but a beauty in the struggle. You don’t have beauty without a beat. Which explains why Frank was Kerouac’s photographic muse and both were the great chroniclers of the 1950’s. Well... we’ve all seen that iconic shot of Kerouac on the balcony – and if you haven’t, shame, shame – capturing the romantic urban solitude of the 20th century poet. You dig?"

Cue_E5_7B_Diner_CHMaxGhost_Phase01_MaxGhost_008="No, you only wanted to be popular. And once you got these amazing powers, your big plan was to trick people into thinking you give a rat's ass."

Cue_E5_7B_Diner_CHMaxGhost_Phase01_MaxGhost_031="No kidding. Chloe trapped you with her drama. Guns, drugs, Rachel... Even stealing money from the handicapped fund. She's just using you, dude."

Cue_E5_7B_Diner_CHMaxGhost_Phase01_MaxGhost_035="Because you let her bully you. It's called "Stockholm Syndrome." But you didn't do that homework... so you'll have to learn the hard way. Like Rachel..."

I expected some try-hard gangster, but he looked more like a dumpster diving troll. Which I guess he kinda is since we were on his turf, testing out my rewind skills for Chloe's amusement."

I expected some try-hard gangster, but he looked more like a dumpster diving troll. Which I guess he kinda is since we were on his turf, testing out my rewind skills for Chloe's amusement."
Chara_Joyce_A="Talking to Joyce Price after five years was almost as intense as seeing Chloe again. Especially right back in "ye olde" Two Whales Diner. That clinking of silverware and the smell of sizzling bacon rewound me back to being a kid, hanging out there with my parents for breakfast. I remember her always smiling at Chloe, even in mischief. Doubt she smiles at her hijinks now, but they still banter like mother and daughter."
Chara_Joyce_B="I moved to Seattle so soon after William died that I never saw how it affected Joyce. I'm glad she's not pissed at me for being selfish and never looking back. I still remember the last time Chloe and I saw him alive. I wonder how often Joyce relives that day? That's the worst kind of rewind: one you can't control. But if I could go back to that moment... what would I do?"
Chara_Joyce_C="I can only imagine how Joyce ended up with David Madsen. Talk about opposites. You can tell she loves him—disturbing as that sounds. Maybe she just wanted a more structured life for herself... Obviously it didn't work out that way with Chloe. I hope they both treat her right. Joyce deserves the best."
E5_Page00_A="I watched Chloe die again. \nKilled by my favorite teacher. Why? \nBecause we were stupid and let Jefferson trick us with a phony text."
E5_Page00_B="So we ended up back at the junkyard, and fell right into his trap. We should have called the police the second we found Rachel, but I had gone along too far with Chloe. I keep thinking I'm invincible, that I'm a real everyday superhero... but no, I'm just Max Caulfield."
E5_Page00_C="Maybe all my powers are an accident of fate. Or am I being punished like Chloe? What have we done to deserve all this pain? What did Rachel do? Kate? William?\n \nThen there's Mark Jefferson... I can't ever call him "mister" again. "
E5_Page00_D="I'm still shocked that he turned out to be the one hiding behind the Dark Room, but if I think back on those "pieces of time," Jefferson has been dropping hints all along. It makes me sick to think how long he's been doing this for — and to whom."
E5_Page00_StartDate="October 11 (...I guess)"
E5_Page01_A="The needle... I can still feel that needle on my skin. Thank God I can't remember Jefferson posing me for most of his sick session. Imagine all those other people who had to suffer through that horror... like Rachel and Kate. That made me determined to get out of that room, at least to stop him and save Chloe. I had to use my focus rewind on multiple photos so often that even I got confused."
E5_Page01_B="Worse still, I knew I was screwing around with various realities again, but I had no other choice. Chloe would not die in a junkyard next to Rachel Amber. And there was no fucking way I was going to let Jefferson be the last person I ever saw. It's hard to even imagine myself in that studio alone with Jefferson acting like that... Everything was so neat and sterile, but it felt like the filthiest place on Earth. If I didn't have this ability to bend time, what would I have done? What could I have done? Sometimes I felt removed, like I was looking at myself going through this hell. But thanks to Jefferson's class photo, he personally helped me to escape."
E5_Page01_CBLAMEDAVID="I'll never forget the way Jefferson looked at me, so cold and mean... I felt like I was on one of those awful true crime shows my mom binge-watches... How does somebody become evil? He actually shot Chloe in the head. Just like that. Motherfucker.\nNow I feel terrible that I blamed David for harassing Kate.... especially since he was after Jefferson all along. We could have been working together if David wasn't so paranoid."
E5_Page01_CBLAMEJEFFERSON="I'll never forget the way Jefferson looked at me, so cold and mean... I felt like I was on one of those awful true-crime shows my mom binge-watches... How does somebody become evil? He actually shot Chloe in the head... just like that. Motherfucker.  \nNow I'm glad I blamed Jefferson for Kate, so at least there's a paper trail for his actions. If only I had David Madsen's info. And to think that I felt guilty about narcing on Jefferson..."
E5_Page01_CBLAMENATHAN="I'll never forget the way Jefferson looked at me, so cold and mean... I felt like I was on one of those awful true-crime shows my mom binge-watches. How does somebody become evil? He actually shot Chloe in the head... just like that. Motherfucker.\nI wish the police had taken Nathan in, after I told Principal Wells that he drugged Kate. He might still be alive and maybe he would have taken down Jefferson too..."
E5_Page01_CWARNVICTORIA="I also feel so terrible that Victoria had to end up in here with me, just because I warned her about Nathan. I should have known that she would rush to Jefferson for protection. Instead, he kidnapped her and almost murdered her... because of me."
E5_Page02_A="I can't believe I was able to focus and rewind into my selfie all the way back to art class on Monday. I turned in my photo for the contest, after I sent a text to David warning him about Jefferson. Whew. The only reason I haven't had a total meltdown is the fact that I do have this incredible power. I have to use it right for once... and maybe never again."
E5_Page02_B="It was weird to be in class with Jefferson, like I wasn't just tortured by him in an underground bunker. I saw him for the first time as he is: a creepy, manipulative psychopath, filled with bullshit. He uses art and passion to seduce people, but behind that there's nothing but hate and perversion. I only pray that I can fix this timeline, not fuck it up."
E5_Page02_C="Max to the future. It feels like I finally made things right. Chloe is alive.\nDavid Madsen became a real everyday hero by busting Jefferson and his dark room, along with Nathan and his father. The Prescotts have lost control of Arcadia Bay. Now I'm the official "Everyday Hero" on my way to San Francisco with Principal Wells, who is a lot more funny and laidback when he's not stressing about Blackwell Academy. It's hard for me to totally relax but all those pieces of time seem to be falling into place."
E5_Page03_A="The Zeitgeist Gallery was a trip. Why does somebody so shy like me want to be famous for her photographs? I don't care about people kissing my ass, I just want to hang out with great artists and learn from them. It was so sweet that my work was displayed in a respected gallery and I got to experience that public response. But I'm not a fan of the spotlight. That Berkeley reporter made me feel like I wouldn't even know what to say. "Oh yes, this selfie represents my soul." I'd tear up my own pictures if I ever talked like that."
E5_Page03_B="But it was so nice just to have a safe, peaceful moment for myself, where my dreams came true instead of my nightmares. I had a real vision of my future and who I wanted to be. So I won't feel bad about rewinding time once again to destroy my contest photo."
E5_Page03_C="The storm is still coming to Arcadia Bay, which means Chloe's life is still in danger. No prize or exhibition is worth losing her again. At least I can use my picture for a truly important reason and yet again try to fix the machineries of time that I keep breaking..."
E5_Page04_A="So I did it. Back in my room again, erasing another timeline... or does that reality go on without me? Am I just creating knots in time? My biggest fear is that I won't be able to rewind when I most need to... or even remember what I've done."
E5_Page04_B="And my head does feel like it's going to burst if I keep on doing this. My nosebleeds are a bad omen. Yet I'm here — I can rip up my contest photo and still warn David about Jefferson. It just means I won't be going to San Francisco. Yet. And I have to protect Chloe from one storm."
E5_Page04_C="I knew things were going too easy. And I messed it all up. As usual.\nJefferson was pissed that I had torn up my contest photo, freaking out about my "wasted talent." Bastard torched my diary, so I couldn't even rewind using my art class selfie. \nSo my whole plan took a shit and I couldn't text David about Jefferson...\nwhich is how I ended up back in this evil Dark Room, after I thought I had escaped."
E5_Page04_D="The worst thing was seeing that Victoria was gone and knowing that Jefferson had already killed her... all because of me. I've never felt so helpless and hopeless in my life. It made me even more determined to rewind time and save Victoria as well..."
E5_Page04_DDONTTELLTRUTH="Amazingly, it was David Madsen who turned up to save me. Thanks to his own surveillance, he was almost Jefferson's shadow and tracked him down to the farmhouse.\nI was able to use my rewind for good and actually help David battle Jefferson.\nI do know that the only way I can save Chloe now is to get that picture that Warren took of us in the parking lot. I just hope he's okay in this storm.\nFinally, I didn't tell David about Chloe... I couldn't. He might have killed Jefferson."
E5_Page04_ETELLTRUTH="Amazingly, it was David Madsen who turned up to save me.

I just hope he's okay in this storm.\nFinally, I told David that Chloe was dead... and he killed Jefferson. I have nothing else to say."
E5_Page05_A="For the first time since my visions, I was able to see the storm manifest in this reality. When I felt the sharp wind from the tornado, everything became more desperate. I was so relieved to get ahold of Warren, but he's definitely trapped in the Two Whales diner with the photo. Yes, this looks like a job for Super Max."
E5_Page05_B="I borrowed Jefferson's car to haul ass and found that Nathan left me a sad voicemail. He only wanted to warn me, to not be blamed for Rachel. But Jefferson wouldn't forgive him...."
E5_Page05_C="Apocalypse Arcadia Bay.\nI've never felt the raw force of nature, but this storm is ground zero. My town is being destroyed and I'm so furious that I didn't pay more attention to my visions. I could have warned and saved so many people... instead of watching them die around me."
E5_Page05_D="I decided I needed to fulfill my destiny, whatever that was, and use my powers for good and more importantly, to not be afraid. There was no more time for fear. \nSo I barely made it to town and helped as much as I could, until I had to rewind to stop a raging fire from blowing up the diner. At least I was able to do something."
E5_Page06_AFRANKDEAD="I almost cried when I saw Joyce and Warren, even though they were scared. But they're strong too and helped everybody in the diner."
E5_Page06_AFRANKFOE="I almost cried when I saw Joyce and Warren, even though they were scared. But they're strong too and helped everybody in the diner. Including Frank, who clearly hates me."
E5_Page06_AFRANKFRIEND="I almost cried when I saw Joyce and Warren, even though they were scared. But they're strong and helped everybody in the diner. Including Frank, who I was glad to see alive."
E5_Page06_BDONTKISSWARRENDONTKISSCHLOE="Considering how insane my life has been this week, kissing Chloe or Warren in the middle of all this time warping would be too strange. I can't even think about my love life... or lack of one. But if I was going to die, maybe I should have kissed one of them for posterity..."
E5_Page06_BDONTKISSWARRENKISSCHLOE="I'm glad Warren is such a good friend. Considering how insane my life has been this week, kissing Chloe instead of him didn't seem that strange. It felt like Chloe and I were flipping off the cruel universe... and if I was going to die, I wanted one kiss from my best friend."
E5_Page06_BKISSWARRENDONTKISSCHLOE="Considering how insane my life has been this week, kissing Warren in the middle of a deadly storm didn't seem to be that strange. It felt like we were flipping off the cruel universe... and if I was going to die, I wanted one kiss from a boy I cared about."
E5_Page06_BKISSWARRENKISSCHLOE="Considering how insane my life has been this week, kissing Chloe, then Warren, didn't seem to be that strange. Both times it felt like we were flipping off the cruel universe... and if I was going to die, I wanted one kiss from two people I truly cared about."
E5_Page06_C="The main thing was that I had Warren's photo and I would get one last chance to save Chloe. I felt queasy considering what a mess I've made, but there was no going back anymore."
E5_Page06_D="Warren rules. I was able to rewind to the End Of The World party with his photo and I felt like I was getting more confident with my time travel skills. It's always hard to deal with Chloe when only I have the benefit of knowing her future. But the one thing Chloe appreciates the most is honesty so I told her everything, from when she was paralyzed to the Dark Room to San Francisco. She didn't want to believe that David was so heroic, but she knows I wouldn't lie. And I could tell Chloe felt awful for what Jefferson did to me."
E5_Page07_AFRIEND="Chloe is back!\nI didn't even care that this was the real end of the world... It just felt so good to hold her again after everything we'd been through. I thought about all the timelines I'd jumped through for her, and how much she's always meant to me...\nOur lives have always been entwined."
E5_Page07_ALOVE="Chloe is back!\nI didn't even care that this was the real end of the world... It just felt so good to hold her again after everything we'd been through. I thought about all the timelines I'd jumped through for her, and how much she's always meant to me...\nOur lives have always been entwined."
E5_Page07_BFRIEND="How could this not be some kind of fate or destiny? \nEven though we're opposites in so many ways, we're also so alike. We'll always be pirates in spirit and we'll always want to take on the world... \nI like to think Chloe and I are here to always support each other. \nBest friends forever, right?"
E5_Page07_BLOVE="How could this not be some kind of fate or destiny? \nEven though we're opposites in so many ways, we're also so alike. We'll always be pirates in spirit and we'll always want to take on the world... It sounds so stupid to say that she's my hero, but if not her, who else? Sometimes Chloe and I feel like yin and yang. \nWho knows? Maybe we're here to give each other strength... or more."
E5_Page07_C="Maxine, you keep fucking up.\nHow many times does Chloe have to die in front of you? \nMaybe it would be better to actually, you know, have a life?"
E5_Page07_D="TAKE A SELFIE, HO! Yes, you're running out of choices. Let's All Go To The Lighthouse! Max, why do you want to kill everybody?\nWhat did everybody ever do to you?\nBully."
E5_Page07_E="FIND MY CAT PIX. PLEASE. MY HEART IS BROKEN."
E5_Page08_AFRIEND="There is nothing like the sense of relief after waking up from a vivid nightmare. Despite all the terrible things that have been happening this past week, I felt so free and hopeful when I finally woke up. And my nightmare was so obvious... All my fears about being an artist, about my rewind power and of course, about my partner in crime and time, Chloe Price."

E5_Page08_BFRIEND="We've been through so much together and we might go through more, depending on how this all ends... either in Heaven or Hella... Sorry, I couldn't resist."
E5_Page08_BLOVE="We've been through so much together and we might go through more, depending on how this all ends... either in Heaven or Hella... Sorry, I couldn't resist."
E5_Page08_CFRIEND="Chloe will always be my best friend, but who knows how she really sees me? I know she wasn't mad I didn't kiss her... I feel like we're more family than couple... just a couple of dorky kids who grew up in a fucked up, amazing world...\nMaybe that's why I hated watching Chloe being so cruel in the nightmare, calling me names and trying to hurt me... I was surprised that it was like a physical pain in my heart. Is that the power of love... or friendship? \nI believe you're about to find out, Max Caulfield."
E5_Page08_CLOVE="Chloe is more than my best friend, but who knows how she really sees me? She did dare me to kiss her, but she seemed surprised that I actually did. I am too, but I don't regret it for a second. Maybe that's why I hated watching Chloe being so cruel in the nightmare, calling me names and flirting with all those people... I was surprised that it was like a physical pain in my heart. Is that the power of friendship... or love? \nI believe you're about to find out, Max Caulfield."

No cellphone or video footage has surfaced yet, which has led local meteorologists to believe that imaginations are in overdrive due to the recent eco-havoc.\n\nBlackwell Security Uncovers Bunker and Scandal\n\nActing on a series of tips from David Madsen (Head of Security at Blackwell Academy), police officers descended Tuesday on a bizarre underground chamber, allegedly used by teacher Mark Jefferson and student Nathan Prescott to drug, kidnap, and photograph young women. Although there were no other signs of physical or sexual assault on the victims, the disturbing revelations have sent shock waves through the tranquil city of Arcadia Bay. Even Sean Prescott, the most powerful businessman in the area, is under investigation for his role as owner of the farmhouse where the high-tech "dark room" studio was located.\n\nCONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE"

Well, we here at the Bay Bud Weekly have seen enough Creature Features to warn you that this is likely a prelude to the appearance of a giant reptilian monster, hell-bent on eco-vengeance.

I was lost in a storm by the lighthouse until I came to the edge of the cliff. Then I saw a giant tornado headed for Arcadia Bay. It was so real that I could feel the rain stinging my face. And I was scared shitless. Then a boat hit the lighthouse and I swear I actually felt like I was going to die. But I woke up in Mr."

Chara_Chloe_A="I absolutely love her blue hair and punk clothes. It makes sense she would become a rebel. She still kinda looks like a pirate. Except one who stage dives. I know she's angry with me because of her body language. I'm glad I can still see the old Chloe in there. Or is that the young Chloe? I'm sure she's still messed up about her dad dying. I would be too. That was a terrible time for Chloe and Joyce."
Chara_Chloe_B="I feel bad because I wonder if I was happy to move away just to avoid the grief... Speaking of grief, it's clear she's all mixed up with Nathan Prescott's shit. I have no idea what's going on between them, but I am going to find out, no matter what."
Chara_Chloe_C="Then there's Chloe Price. What do you say to your best friend after five years of silence? After finding out you saved her life in a bathroom? NOTHING. I feel so lame for not staying in touch... or even text. I have no idea how to process seeing Chloe like this again. For one thing, she looks so similar but so different... She's all grown up now, but it doesn't seem like she's only one year older than me."
Chara_David_A="Whoa, I swear that security guard is the biggest ass here. And that's saying a lot. He always treats everybody like they've committed a crime or they're about to commit one. He grilled me in the hall today and I thought he was going to arrest me. I don't know much about him but I heard he was kicked out of the army or something."
Chara_David_B="So of course he would end up at Blackwell Academy in charge of security. Aren't you supposed to feel, I don't know, SECURE, on campus?"
Chara_David_C="Bro-dude swaggers everywhere with that badge and gun like he's looking to tase somebody. He would make a good photo portrait of authority though. Who does a guy like that marry? I feel sorry for his family. It would be like living in a barracks. Shudder. Just another person I have to avoid at Blackwell. Collect ‘em all."
Chara_Franks_B="Though he didn't look like a serial killer, his vibe (aura, energy, whateva) was BAD. I could literally feel the hair on my arms prickling. He wanted the money Chloe owed him, so it didn't make sense he would hurt her but I wasn't going to take a chance... So yes, I actually threatened him with David's gun. Ridiculous. Fortunately none of us ended up like "Reservoir Dogs" and I saw that maybe Frank isn't as scary as I thought..."
Chara_Franks_C="But I don't want Chloe near him EVER again. Since he was wearing one of Rachel Amber's bracelets for WTF reasons, I doubt Chloe will be partying with him anymore. But he's at the top of our suspect list now..."
Chara_Jefferson_A="Not only is Mark Jefferson one of the best photographers in the world, he's also my teacher. And one of the reasons I wanted to come to Blackwell. How often do you get to be mentored by one of your inspirations? I‘ve always loved his deco and goth style and he's so versatile with all of his incredible print and advertising work. Still, Jefferson can be a bit condescending. He's pretty hip for his age, but kinda aloof and sometimes pretentious. He has this smug smile when he thinks he's right..."
Chara_Jefferson_B="But I do think he's preparing us for how tough it is to be a full time "artist". He acts like he understands my own work and obsession with analog images."
Chara_Jefferson_C="He really wants me to enter a photo in this "Everyday Heroes" contest but I've done a good job of avoiding that. The winner gets to fly to San Francisco to represent Blackwell Academy and get national exposure. I'd like to think my work could be good enough to win and I'm honored Jefferson even bugs me about the contest."
Chara_Kate_A="I've forgotten if I've ever seen Kate Marsh smile or laugh in the past month. She's really sweet and nice, even though the other students make fun of her abstinence campaign. Even if they act immature, everybody at Blackwell are seniors, not high school freshmen... She gets a lot of shit in fact. I know she's involved in a lot of religious groups, but she doesn't preach to me so I don't care."
Chara_Kate_B="But she's been extra quiet and introverted the past couple weeks. She looks like she's in zombie mode. I wish I could help her, but I can barely help myself. I wonder if all that bullying has worn her down... I can see how it would. I have to make an effort to talk to her more often, maybe invite her to tea or a movie."
Chara_Kate_C="Although she's an adult I bet she's not "allowed" to watch "R" rated films..."
Chara_Max_A="My name is Max Caulfield, and ever since I was a little kid I knew I wanted to be a photographer. I've always seen the world through my own lens finder. Maybe it's a way for me to be part of the world, but at a safe distance."
Chara_Max_B="For some reason I was always drawn to old analog camera gear rather than digital tech. I love all kinds of styles and techniques but for me, the instant camera selfie is the one I love most. I don't care if people make fun of me or not. I'm in great company, right? And now I've come all the way back to my childhood home to study photography at Blackwell Academy, a private school for 12th grade seniors."
Chara_Max_C="On a scholarship even! I originally left behind Chloe, my "best friend forever" (at least until I left without talking to her once in five years) and it feels so weird to be back here without seeing her yet. So I’m eighteen now, an official adult even though I don’t always feel so wise or mature, and I’m ready to begin a whole new life here with retro camera at my side."
Chara_Max_D=""Say Cheese!""
Chara_Nathan_A="Just when I thought Victoria Chase would be the worst of my social problems, now I have to deal with Nathan Prescott. But I guess he was the one who triggered my crazy rewind power by shooting that girl in the bathroom. He's 19 and already a scary fucking prick."
Chara_Nathan_B="On one hand, I do kinda feel bad for Nathan because he doesn't seem to be in control, like he's doped up or over medicated. On the other, he's an asshole who nobody has called out. And he almost killed (/did kill?) a girl on campus. Should I go straight to the police? What do I say about my rewind power? Like I'd say anything. I just have to watch my own back from now on. Oh, school days!"
Chara_Nathan_C="I guess I have a little advantage on Nathan by being able to manipulate time, but if he shoots me I may not be able to reverse anything. I have to be careful around him, especially since he's obviously got friends in high places as his family last name is practically branded on every building here at Blackwell. His money against mine..."
Chara_Principal_A="He also seems a little stressed out. I would be too if I had to oversee Blackwell and all its drama. I thought I smelled alcohol on his breath but that could have been his cologne. Right? But I remember my first meeting in his office and he was so nice and made me feel like I was becoming part of a special world."
Chara_Principal_B="I can't figure out where Principal Wells is coming from. For some reason, he seems to be suspicious of me at all times. Who knew I was that much trouble? He wanted to know why I was zoning out in the halls. I stuttered like a fool. He has so much power over my scholarship I get uber-nervous around him. I've seen him laughing with other teachers and students, so I know he must have a problem with me."
Chara_Principal_C="He said he hoped I would become a great photographer and someday return the favor to Blackwell. I thought that was a bit of wishful thinking, but it made me feel good. I just need to lay low around him. Until I can somehow gain his trust."
Chara_Rachel_A="Where Is Rachel Amber? Even though Blackwell Academy feels so remote and tranquil, you still get sad reminders of reality, like "Missing Person" posters literally wallpapered all over campus. I already know her name through osmosis. I guess she was a popular student here and vanished six months ago. Rachel has a great picture on her "Missing Person" poster. She looks posed and pretty, like a model."
Chara_Rachel_B="Of course, I wonder who took the photo. Did she run away from home? I'd like to hope so. For her sake. It's so depressing. And I feel awful for her parents. What a shitty thing to go through. SIGH. No matter how much Blackwell seems like a secret bubble of knowledge, you can't escape the real world..."
Chara_Victoria_A="She does everything but sit in his lap. He keeps his distance though. We can all tell she's trying to win the "Everyday Heroes" contest. I'm sure it drives her crazy when there's somebody she can't buy or seduce. Ha!"
Chara_Victoria_B="For reals? I wish her parents could see her in action. They'd cut off that trust fund fast. Then again, she's in the Vortex Club, and they seem to own the school, so maybe that's why she doesn't give a shit."
Chara_Victoria_C="Then there's Victoria Chase, the elite of Blackwell Academy, and a total bitch. And I hate saying that. I just don't know why somebody who's so rich and beautiful needs to be so fucking mean. 18 year olds at a prestigious academy should be evolving into artists and scholars... not reality show contestants. Victoria does everything for maximum drama. She actually wastes her time calling me out in class and taunting Kate Marsh."
Chara_Victoria_D="The odd thing is that she does know art and photography. She can even say all those French names that break my tongue. Her work is a little cold, but she has a good eye."
Chara_Victoria_E="She also has an eye for Mr. Jefferson, which is so obvious that I'm embarrassed for her."
Chara_Warren_A="I knew if I gave Warren my phone he would blow it up for "science". He wants his flash drive back after letting me borrow it for less than a week. He told me to watch everything because he has tons of cool TV shows and films on there."
Chara_Warren_B="Warren is a geek, but he definitely lets you know where he stands, I don't think he would ever lie to me. It feels good to have at least one strong ally the same age here... And he makes me smile."
Chara_Warren_C="Thank god it wasn't porn. And I am thankful for Warren. He's like a real friend and we share a lot of the same interests. He loves science but he really understands art and appreciates great photography. Even though he says he loves my pictures, I can't tell if he's just being nice."
E0_Page00_A="July 10, 2013"
E0_Page00_B="I GOT ACCEPTED INTO BLACKWELL ACADEMY."
E0_Page00_C="If words could dance this would be a rave. Even though I've never been to one. But who cares because I GOT INTO BLACKWELL ACADEMY! I didn't think I would be so excited since it's not like I didn't used to live in the same town. But when I saw the text from the Blackwell scholarship office, I could literally feel my pulse speed up."
E0_Page00_D="I thought it was going to say, "Sorry! Thanks for playing!" It took me a few seconds before I read the whole thing. I guess I wanted to enjoy that last moment of blissful ignorance. And when I saw the first word, "Congratulations..." I think I screamed."
E0_Page00_E="My mom cried, and my dad laughed. They're so weird. But they're happy and this means extra financial support because they don't have to pay anything to Blackwell. This means new clothes and if I can work it, a new laptop."
E0_Page00_F="Oh, and I have to keep telling myself in caps that I AM GOING TO BLACKWELL ACADEMY."
E0_Page01_A="August 18, 2013"
E0_Page01_B="So this is it. I'm leaving Seattle to go back to Arcadia Bay. Usually people go to the High School closest to home. I suppose I am too, it's just I haven't lived there for 5 years. Out of all the best photography programs in the world, I choose to go to the smallest, back in a town I was excited about leaving."
E0_Page01_C="Maybe I wanted to come back all along, just to see if Chloe and I are still even friends. But I do wish Chloe could have moved with us to Seattle... That city was made for her. When we would play pirates in our rooms and in the woods, it seemed like Seattle was that fabled faraway island of treasure and adventure that we were always seeking. With coffee shops."
E0_Page01_D="But Seattle wasn't like a fable. Au contraire. Now Blackwell Academy seems more exotic to me than any other place in the world. To study photography under Mark Jefferson... SIGH. Insert hearts and flowers. Plus there will be cool diverse students from everywhere. It won't be like my high school now... I never really found a groove with my classmates. (Or boys...) I'm lucky I have a couple great friends here. But it's time to ship out."
E0_Page01_E="So maybe Arcadia Bay will actually turn out to be the island of treasure and adventure I've been looking for..."
E0_Page02_A="August 25, 2013"
E0_Page02_B="Shit is krazy here. I didn't realize how much crap I had to pack until I had to pack all my crap. Mom and Dad are gettin' a little too excited I'm clearing out my room. Tho I caught mom crying when she was packing my shirts."
E0_Page02_C="That made me want to cry like a little girl. And never leave Seattle. So instead of packing, I feel like burning all my clothes, then just raiding a thrift store to build up a new Max wardrobe over my junior year. Not that I even have an old Max wardrobe."
E0_Page02_D="Nobody will know me except for Chloe and who knows how different we are now. So I can cut my hair, get a tat and some piercings... Maybe date a cute foreign exchange artiste from Paris or Rome. I can do anything. Unless I get busted."
E0_Page02_E="And there will be so many supercool chances for my photography to get exposed! Thinking about that is when I get scared, but excited. And then I don't feel like crying at all. I get tingles down my arms, sensing the universe opening up for me. I can't wait to leave."
E0_Page02_F="I just want things to be... different at Blackwell."
E0_Page03_A="September 2, 2013, 12:07 am"
E0_Page03_B="My first entry from my new dorm room the night before my first day at Blackwell. Whew! I haven't had any time to write or even take pictures since I got here. My shit is in boxes all over the room, which is small, but mine, and I never want to leave. I can't wait to decorate! I plan a whole wall o' photos. I did meet some of my dorm mates, tho I suck at remembering names so I won't bother right now. But I think I can already see who's going to be cool to me and who's not. It's a bitch trying to get settled into a new school and social scene after I finally found good friends in Seattle."
E0_Page03_C="But I'm here now, and this is the start of my new life."
E0_Page03_D="Sweet dreams."
E0_Page03_E="September 3, 2013"
E0_Page03_F="Blackwell sucks ass! I told myself not to whine so soon, but damn... The day started like Christmas morning. I barely had any dreams because I was so pumped to start my first official day of my new life. Like a dork I couldn't figure out what to wear, so I chose what was on the floor. I'm no good with names and faces right away, but I picked up some names like KateBrookeTaylorAlyssa..."
E0_Page03_G="And how could I forget Victoria Chase? Rich, stylish, entitled. I could feel INSTANT JUDGMENT when she looked at my raggedy ass clothes. As if I'm at Blackwell to strike fashion poses... Maybe I'm being extra crispy sensitive, but I think Victoria wants life here to be like her own reality show. Ugh..."
E0_Page04_A="So that wasn't fun along with my general social unease... I thought it would be easier being back. Call the waaahmbulance! I don't want this day to end all "Woe Is Max". It was incredible to walk across the green campus in the morning mist. I love the stone steps and brick walls of Blackwell. Everything is a picture waiting to be taken... Speaking of, at least one great thing did happen today: Mr. Jefferson's photography class. Sigh..."
E0_Page04_B="There's more to tell but journal, forgive me, I'm truly wiped out."
E0_Page04_C="September 4"
E0_Page04_D="I have an assload of homework already. So much bullshit. At least give us noobs a day to acclimate. But, to prove I'm not a total loser, I made a new friend in my science class. His name is Warren Graham and he's a serious geek, plus he's dark and witty."
E0_Page04_E="He comes across as kind of a know-it-all, but it turns out he does kind of know a lot. We talked about photographers, and he actually named a few I'd never heard of. We traded numbers and he'll be a good study partner (or a good friend). I'll need at least one based on the clique action here. I thought being 18 meant I didn't have to deal with this teenage drama anymore. I THOUGHT."
E0_Page04_F="At least I get to research famous photographers for some of my homework. Mr. Jefferson assigned us a ton of reading, but this is exactly what I want to study. Jefferson is supercool and superchill."
E0_Page04_G="He doesn't try to be too hip, just says what he thinks and expects us to as well. I think he's a genius. OMG I WANT TO MARRY HIM. Just joking. This one class is worth all the social dysfunction."
E0_Page05_A="September 15"
E0_Page05_B="Homework is kicking my ass. I bet the teachers grade harder just to stop you from feeling special. But Victoria Chase and her snob minions still front like they're honored guests of Blackwell. The bros here aren't that different. Nathan Prescott is Victoria's male clone, with way more money and attitude, if that's possible."
E0_Page05_C="His family is the oldest in Arcadia Bay and I heard stories about them when I was a kid. The Prescotts give a shitload of bank to Blackwell, so Nathan acts like he literally owns the school. Yesterday during class, he put his feet on the desk, started texting and the teacher didn't say jack!"
E0_Page05_D="I'd get suspended. But him and Victoria are part of this silly elite "Vortex Club" that puts on popular parties and so they get their way. It's good to be the king and queen."
E0_Page05_E="I don't want to slam everybody. I do like Kate Marsh, she's down the hall and in one of my classes. She's so pretty AND sweet and friendly. It makes her more beautiful than the beeatches here like Victoria who think beauty is just your face and outfit. See? I'm already playing their drama games. No more!"
E0_Page06_A="September 23"
E0_Page06_B="Finally had a chance to take some actual shots around campus today. A perfect blue sky day. I always forget how great I feel after I take pictures when I've been slacking off. Speaking of pictures, Mr. Jefferson told us about the national "Everyday Heroes" photo contest he wants us all to enter."
E0_Page06_C="The winner gets a trip to San Francisco and lots of publicity. He wants just one photograph from each student. This is exactly why I wanted to come to Blackwell and of course I'm scared shitless to enter. At least I have a couple weeks before the deadline in October. So I have plenty of time to stress and procrastinate. Sigh."
E0_Page06_D="September 30"
E0_Page06_E="I don't know whether I love it or hate it here. I'm trying to keep up with my science class of all things. Like I give a shit or even understand it. Good thing I know Warren. Too bad I can't clone him to take my place in class."
E0_Page06_F="Ms. Grant is much cooler than the class. She explains particle physics so even boneheads like me can kinda understand. I love how she relates society to science and vice versa. I can tell she's committed and passionate about life. Unlike some of us in her class, but I'm trying to engage more, even if it means asking actual questions in class instead of hiding in the back. I'm just glad I'm not the only social misfit here."
E0_Page06_G="Now how much homework are you avoiding?"
E0_Page07_A="October. My favorite month. The best weather of the year. I love watching the leaves change color, turning into tiny flames. But it's still too damn hot (thanks global warming) and I can't bust out the big coats and sweaters or scary movies yet. Soon. Kate let me borrow "The October Country" by Ray Bradbury."
E0_Page07_B="I haven't read much by him (which caused Warren to almost revoke my geek cred before I held up my copy of "Battle Royale") but he nails the autumn atmosphere of small towns. The last time I wore a Halloween costume was with Chloe... I have pictures in one of my old albums..."
E0_Page07_C="I should find a real Halloween party to crash so I can experience some social mingling. It's that or a Vortex Club strokefest swimming party. Or is that backstrokefest? You so punny, Max."
E0_Page07_D="At least I'm trying to climb out of my cocoon. I shouldn't expect my life to completely change after a few weeks of Blackwell Academy. As my parents love telling me on a loop, "You have all the time in the world.""
E0_Page07_E="October 1"
E1_Page00_A="October 7"
E1_Page00_B="This will be the weirdest journal entry I will ever make. So weird I don't know how or where to start. But it started with the most vivid dream of my life. I was lost in a storm by the lighthouse until I came to the edge of the cliff."
E1_Page00_C="Then I saw a giant tornado headed for Arcadia Bay. It was so real that I could feel the rain stinging my face. And I was scared shitless. Then a boat hit the lighthouse and I swear I actually felt like I was going to die."
E1_Page00_D="But I woke up in Mr. Jefferson's class and I wasn't even sleeping. I almost fell out of my chair. Jefferson called on me but I totally blew the answer. Of course Victoria pounced on me and made me look like a bigger idiot. She's so awful. Then I didn't have the guts to turn in a photo for the "Everyday Heroes" contest while Victoria did her usual suck-up to Jefferson. He's so cool and he clearly wants me to succeed."
E1_Page01_A="I felt so shitty. I just wanted to get to the bathroom to be alone and wash my face after that nightmare. Or daymare. Once I got to the bathroom I saw this odd beautiful blue butterfly flutter in and right when I took a photo of it in the corner, Nathan Prescott came in freaking out, talking to himself. I hid in the corner and this punk girl came in and they started arguing about drugs and money. Then Nathan actually whipped out a gun and SHOT the girl."
E1_Page01_B="This is where it gets strange."
E1_Page01_C="When Nathan fired the gun I came around the corner and reached out for some dumb reason, as if I could stop the bullet. But suddenly I could feel the world twisting around me and this pressure in my head, everything seemed to rewind and I found myself right back in class at my desk!"
E1_Page01_D="I literally thought I had been dosed with some drug until I calmed myself down. I saw everything happen in class the way it did before. Major Groundhog Day-ja vue. Somehow I was able to actually rewind time."
E1_Page02_A="I knew the only way to find out if I was having a breakdown was to go back to the bathroom and see if I could save that girl from Nathan this time. I had no idea how either. I just knew I couldn't live with myself if I let her die again. I escaped Jefferson this time by knowing exactly how to answer his questions and rushed to the bathroom."
E1_Page02_B="I hid in the corner again and I couldn't believe it when Nathan showed up, freaking out all over again."
E1_Page02_C="Then the girl came into the bathroom, and before Nathan could shoot her, I smashed open the ancient fire alarm and scared both of them away. Victory!"
E1_Page02_D="...Until I got grilled by the security chief, David Madsen, who thinks he's Chuck Norris: Blackwell Ranger. Nathan Prescott almost kills a girl in the bathroom but no, I'M THE PROBLEM. I was so glad when Principal Wells stepped in to shoo David away."
E1_Page03_A="I wanted to inform Principal Wells that I saw Nathan waving a gun in the bathroom, but I didn't want to mention the girl, or my new rewind abilities, for obvious reasons. I wouldn't know how to tell him without making me look crazy."
E1_Page03_B="He grilled me for being out in the hall during a fire alarm. I'm still glad I didn't have to tell him that Blackwell's most big fucking deal student actually killed a girl in a previous timeline..."
E1_Page03_C="So my school day started with an apocalyptic dream, and then ended with saving a life and discovering I have some kind of power to rewind time. I don't know how to top that."
E1_Page03_D="Then I made the possibly fatal decision to inform Principal Wells that I saw Nathan waving a gun in the bathroom. I didn't think I should mention the girl, or my new rewind abilities, for obvious reasons."
E1_Page03_E="He didn't want to believe me and almost made me feel like shit for telling him that Blackwell's most big fucking deal student would carry a firearm to class. I couldn't tell him that he actually killed a girl in a previous timeline..."
E1_Page03_F="So my school day started with an apocalyptic dream then ended with saving a life and discovering I have some kind of power to rewind time. I don't know how to top that."
E1_Page04_A="Everything feels so surreal right now. I can't talk to anybody about this, well... The only person I could, I haven't seen in five years. I could confide in Warren, he's smart and knows science, so maybe he could even think of an explanation. Though I have no idea what that could be."
E1_Page04_B="Until I can figure this out, I better stay on the down low with this stuff and focus on my classes. Warren sent me a text asking for his flash drive back, even though I haven't had chance to check out all the cool shows and films on there."
E1_Page04_C="I watched a few episodes of Doctor Who and X-Files; binged on Fullmetal Alchemist; then Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (all kinds of Amazon women black and white badassery); Tetsuo (a total cyberpunk trip with amazing visuals); and Scott Pilgrim (for about the millionth time)."
E1_Page05_A="On a side note, I saw a "Missing Persons" poster on campus for "Rachel Amber" a pretty Blackwell student who vanished. It's so sad to see her smiling face and think about the awful things that could happen. If there was a way for me to rewind back six months, I totally would."
E1_Page05_B="I had to go back to the dorm to get Warren's flash drive and yes, Victoria and her Vortex Vixens blocked me from getting in, and even took my picture... It was so "high school movie" I can't believe she did it."
E1_Page05_C="She actually told me to "Go fuck your selfie" though, it was funny. I don't know why she has to act that way. She already has everything she wants, doesn't she? And she forced me to use my rewind until I finally came up with a way to get her out of my way. I don't want to use this power for trivial bullshit, especially if I have been given an actual "gift" from the universe, but it did give me a chance to test it out."
E1_Page06_A="But I felt like shit seeing Victoria sitting there by herself on the steps covered in paint. She didn't look like the Queen Beeatch of Blackwell, just a lonely girl as confused as me. I knew I had to find out if she was okay. She was actually nice and apologized. She even deleted the picture she took of me off her phone. So maybe there's hope for the future."
E1_Page06_B="More high school drama... Juliet wouldn't let Dana out of her room because she thought Zachary was sexting Dana. So stupid. I was so tired from everything, and since Dana borrowed Warren's flash drive, I had to intervene."
E1_Page06_C="Juliet told me Victoria was the one who gave her the inside scoop on Zach and Dana, so I knew that Victoria was playing them all. I snuck into Victoria's room and onto her laptop and found out that she was indeed lying through her ass just to create drama. Of course, I felt like a weasel going through Victoria's room and laptop."
E1_Page07_A="I also saw David Madsen hassling Kate Marsh. I couldn't hear everything, but he was accusing her of something. All that guy can do is point fingers! I got so pissed I went over to stop him from being such a bully. He's a security guard, not a stormtrooper. He was an asshole (as usual) but I felt good about what I did and Kate seemed truly happy that somebody stood up for her. And I did that without using my rewind power."
E1_Page07_B="Once I gave Juliet the proof that Victoria was behind this, I went to get Warren's flash drive from Dana. She was in a weird mood, so I had a look around to see if I could find out why."
E1_Page07_C="I found a home pregnancy test along with a note from Logan and a doctor's appointment. Dana admitted she was pregnant and I realized that all of my friends have troubles that are just as significant as mine. Sigh."
E1_Page07_D="Once I gave Juliet the proof that Victoria was behind it all, I went to get Warren's flash drive from Dana. She was in a weird mood, but we said nasty things about Victoria and I think it definitely made her feel better. We talked about Warren and Dana implied he likes me. Ew."
E1_Page07_E="I also saw David Madsen hassling Kate Marsh. I couldn't hear everything, but he accused her of something. All that guy can do is point fingers and I got so pissed. He's a security guard not a stormtrooper. But like the chickenshit I can be, I didn't go over and stand up for her. I was scared. Sometimes I still feel like a little kid. And yes, Kate was not happy I didn't come over to stand by her. So I let her down and my rewind power was useless."
E1_Page08_A="This day keeps getting stranger. I don't even believe what I'm writing. And I can't even do a simple task like giving Warren back his flash drive without getting into a situation."
E1_Page08_B="In this case though, it turned out half bad and half good, which I guess is the yin and yang of life. When I met with Warren in the lot and checked out his new retro-wheels, guess who showed up? Nathan Prescott, freaking out all over again. He got all up in my face to accuse me of bullshit."
E1_Page08_C="Even though I was scared because I know what he did to that girl in the bathroom, I was more furious."
E1_Page08_D="Then the "girl in the bathroom" pulled up in a truck. My former best friend, Chloe Price."
E1_Page08_E="We both looked at each other like WTF? Next thing I knew, I was in her truck as Warren earned his man card and tried to get Nathan off my ass. I owe Warren big-time. Seeing Chloe for the first time in five years was such a shock I was almost paralyzed. Especially after realizing that Nathan had almost killed her right in front of me."
E1_Page08_F="Now Chloe shows up out of the blue to save me."
E1_Page09_A="Of all the bizarro and unexplainable shit happening today, sitting in Chloe's battered truck, listening to music and staring at her dashboard bobblehead might be at the top."
E1_Page09_B="So I tried to process the fact that Chloe and I were two best friends who didn't know each other anymore. She had blue hair, piercings, and cool boots and I... I looked like a dork. I didn't know where to start and she wasn't exactly extending an olive branch."
E1_Page09_C="So we sat like strangers. At least I had time to catch my breath and realize that in the parking lot melee with Nathan and Warren, my camera got busted up. I didn't care considering everything else going on. But it sucked on top of everything else going on."
E1_Page09_D="Going back to Chloe's old house for the first time in five years was like the ultimate rewind. Some things were obviously different, but some things weren't. The house smelled exactly the same as it did when we were growing up."
E1_Page09_E="Chloe's room was like an exploded version of her new adult self, cool and chaotic. I could tell she was pissed. She wanted to blaze up and chill, so I explored her room to play catch up on what she was into these days."
E1_Page10_A="Then I found a photo of Chloe with Rachel Amber. Chloe freaked and laid into me for not calling her once. I deserved it. She had become best friends with Rachel and they were going to bail on Arcadia Bay and head out to Los Angeles for fame and fortune. I could tell how much Chloe cared about Rachel since she was the one putting up the posters."
E1_Page10_B="I felt even shittier about leaving Chloe alone all those years when she most needed me. You suck, Max. But Chloe is obsessed with Rachel, the missing girl. She says Rachel vanished after meeting some amazing dude... probably some psycho online. Chloe wanted to smoke out and be alone so I went downstairs to find tools to fix my camera."
E1_Page11_A="Snooping deeper, I hit the paranoia jackpot and found a whole mini-surveillance set-up of Chloe's house, with cameras in the halls and some rooms. Truly creepy shit. What kind of uber-paranoid puts cameras throughout his own home? Chloe's stepfather, I guess. I see why she's got serious attitude."
E1_Page11_B="When I got back upstairs, I couldn't fix the stupid camera. But Chloe saw the butterfly photo and knew I was in the bathroom and set off the alarm. Her attitude totally changed and she realized that I had saved her life."
E1_Page11_C="Even though it could have gone the other way... She was so happy like when we were kids and it was great to see her face light up. She even gave me her dad's awesome old instamatic as a symbol of our reunion. She cranked up the tunes and started dancing on her bed like a maniac. She even got me to shake my booty. Just a bit."
E1_Page11_D="That's when Chloe's stepfather showed up. And it was David Madsen."
E1_Page12_A="I couldn't hide and then David came in, angry about the music and that I was there. He was even scarier off campus because he didn't have the school around him. He accused Chloe of taking one of his guns."
E1_Page12_B="Then shit got real. David found Chloe's joint and flipped out on us. I said it was my pot and David got in my face, but Chloe stepped in like a boss."
E1_Page12_C="David has it out for me now, but whatever. Chloe was so touched I was willing to take the blame."
E1_Page12_D="Chloe and I decided to get out of there and catch up on our exploring...like best friends."
E1_Page12_E="I couldn't hide and then David came in, angry about the music and that I was there. He was even scarier off campus because he didn't have the school around him. He accused Chloe of taking one of his guns."
E1_Page12_F="Then shit got real. David found Chloe's joint and flipped out on us. She said it was mine, but I didn't take the blame. Maybe I should have."
E1_Page12_G="But I was thinking about my Blackwell scholarship over my best friend. And David truly scared me. Anyway, now Chloe was pissed at me all over again."
E1_Page12_H="Back to square one. I keep trying to make the right choices, but I keep screwing it up..."
E1_Page12_I="I had to hide in the closet and then David came in, angry about the music. He was even scarier off campus because he didn't have the school around him. He accused Chloe of taking one of his guns."
E1_Page12_J="Then shit got real. David found Chloe's joint and flipped out on her. She didn't back down and he actually slapped her. Bastard."
E1_Page12_K="I thought Chloe would be pissed I didn't step in to help, but she didn't think it would matter."
E1_Page12_L="We decided to get out of there and catch up on our exploring... like best friends."
E1_Page12_M="I had to hide in the closet and then David came in, angry about the music. He was even scarier off campus because he didn't have the school around him. He accused Chloe of taking one of his guns."
E1_Page12_N="Then shit got real. David found Chloe's joint and flipped out on her. I couldn't take it, considering she almost died that morning, and I stepped out and said it was my weed."
E1_Page12_O="David tried to threaten me but Chloe was awesome and threatened him. He backed out of there quick. Chloe was so touched I took the blame."
E1_Page12_P="Of course, she did steal one of David's guns and waved it around like an idiot. Too much firepower for this girl to encounter in one day. Or one life. Fortunately, Chloe and I decided to get out of there and catch up on our exploring... like best friends."
E1_Page13_A="So Chloe and I ended up at the lighthouse, watching the sunset. Chloe was mellow and told me more about David and his uber-paranoia at school and home. It all made sense."
E1_Page13_B="But I wanted to know why Chloe was in that bathroom with Nathan Prescott. She told me he deals drugs and she wanted to blackmail him to pay off some big loan. It's so strange where our lives have gone since the last time we hung out when we were thirteen."
E1_Page13_C="Then I had another nightmare. Or duskmare. I was right back at the lighthouse in a storm, except this time I was following a ghostly deer until I got to the edge of the cliff. I could see the tornado destroying everything in its path, and again I could feel the cold sting of the rain. The lighthouse was crumbling and I felt so helpless watching the tornado move towards the town."
E1_Page13_D="Then Chloe snapped me out of the dream and I told her what I saw. And as if to make the day end on another unusual note, snow started falling from the sky in the warm sunset. It felt so weird, ominous and beautiful all at once."
E1_Page13_E="Especially standing there with my best friend."
E1_Page13_F="And on that positive thought, I have officially earned a great night's sleep."
E1_page06_D="Still, I can't believe I took a picture of Victoria coated in paint for revenge. I must be feeling pretty brave. She vowed revenge, so I guess I've officially made my first enemy at Blackwell."
E1_page07_F="I'm starting to get the hang of this whole rewind thing. I don't want to waste this power, but there has to be a reason it was given to me, so I better learn how to use it right. I started by saving Alyssa from getting a football fueled headshot. I admit it felt amazing just to help Alyssa with something as simple as that."
E1_page07_G="I really need to get the hang of this whole rewind thing. I don't want to waste this power, but there has to be a reason it was given to me so I better learn how to use it right. I could have used it for something as easy as warning Alyssa she was going to get a football fueled headshot. How selective should I be with this power?"

EpilepsyDisclaimer="IMPORTANT HEALTH WARNING ABOUT PLAYING VIDEO GAMES\nPhotosensitive seizures\nA very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these "photosensitive epileptic seizures" while watching video games.\nThese seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including light headedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, or momentary loss of awareness.\nSeizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects.\nImmediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms—children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures. The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions: Sit farther from the screen; use a smaller screen; play in a well-lit room; do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued.\nIf you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing."
